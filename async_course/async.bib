    abstract = "Blind and visually impaired mathematics students must rely on accessible materials such as tactile diagrams to learn mathematics. However, these compensatory materials are frequently found to offer students inferior opportunities for engaging in mathematical practice and do not allow sensorily heterogenous students to collaborate. Such prevailing problems of access and interaction are central concerns of Universal Design for Learning (UDL), an engineering paradigm for inclusive participation in cultural praxis like mathematics. Rather than directly adapt existing artifacts for broader usage, UDL process begins by interrogating the praxis these artifacts serve and then radically re-imagining tools and ecologies to optimize usability for all learners. We argue for the utility of two additional frameworks to enhance UDL efforts: (a) enactivism, a cognitive-sciences view of learning, knowing, and reasoning as modal activity; and (b) ethnomethodological conversation analysis (EMCA), which investigates participants' multimodal methods for coordinating action and meaning. Combined, these approaches help frame the design and evaluation of opportunities for heterogeneous students to learn mathematics collaboratively in inclusive classrooms by coordinating perceptuo-motor solutions to joint manipulation problems. We contextualize the thesis with a proposal for a pluralist design for proportions, in which a pair of students jointly operate an interactive technological device.",

    abstract = "An ongoing challenge in the analysis of document collections is how to summarize content in terms of a set of inferred themes that can be interpreted substantively in terms of topics. The current practice of parameterizing the themes in terms of most frequent words limits interpretability by ignoring the differential use of words across topics. Here, we show that words that are both frequent and exclusive to a theme are more effective at characterizing topical content, and we propose a regularization scheme that leads to better estimates of these quantities. We consider a supervised setting where professional editors have annotated documents to topic categories, organized into a tree, in which leaf-nodes correspond to more specific topics. Each document is annotated to multiple categories, at different levels of the tree. We introduce a hierarchical Poisson convolution model to analyze these annotated documents. A parallelized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler allows the inference to scale to millions of documents. The model leverages the structure among categories defined by professional editors to infer a clear semantic description for each topic in terms of words that are both frequent and exclusive. In this supervised setting, we validate the efficacy of word frequency and exclusivity at characterizing topical content on two very large collections of documents, from Reuters and the New York Times. In an unsupervised setting, we then consider a simplified version of the model that shares the same regularization scheme with the previous model. We carry out a large randomized experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk to demonstrate that topic summaries based on frequency and exclusivity, estimated using the proposed regularization scheme, are more interpretable than currently established frequency-based summaries, and that the proposed model produces more efficient estimates of exclusivity than the currently established models.",

In this paper we explore the characteristics of Scratch programs. To this end we have scraped the Scratch public repository and retrieved 250,000 projects. We present an analysis of these projects in three different dimensions. Initially, we look at the types of blocks used and the size of the projects. We then investigate complexity, used abstractions and programming concepts. Finally we detect code smells such as large scripts, dead code and duplicated code blocks. Our results show that 1) most Scratch programs are small, however Scratch programs consisting of over 100 sprites exist, 2) programming abstraction concepts like procedures are not commonly used and 3) Scratch programs do suffer from code smells including large scripts and unmatched broadcast signals.",

We conducted a review of the conceptual frameworks being used in empirical studies, focusing on the premises of the conceptualizations.

Many use nonlinear operations on co-occurrence statistics, and have hand-tuned hyperparameters and reweighting methods. This paper proposes a new generative model, a dynamic version of the log-linear topic model of\textasciitilde\textbackslash citet\{mnih2007three\}. The methodological novelty is to use the prior to compute closed form expressions for word statistics. This provides a theoretical justification for nonlinear models like PMI, word2vec, and GloVe, as well as some hyperparameter choices. It also helps explain why low-dimensional semantic embeddings contain linear algebraic structure that allows solution of word analogies, as shown by\textasciitilde\textbackslash citet\{mikolov2013efficient\} and many subsequent papers. Experimental support is provided for the generative model assumptions, the most important of which is that latent word vectors are fairly uniformly dispersed in space.",

In this work we propose a measure to identify the correct number of topics and offer empirical evidence in its favor in terms of classification accuracy and the number of topics that are naturally present in the corpus. We show the merit of the measure by applying it on real-world as well as synthetic data sets(both text and images). In proposing this measure, we view LDA as a matrix factorization mechanism, wherein a given corpus C is split into two matrix factors M1 and M2 as given by Cd{${\\_\ast}$}w = M 1d{${\\_\ast}$}t x Qt{${\\_\ast}$}w. Where d is the number of documents present in the corpus and w is the size of the vocabulary. The quality of the split depends on ``t'', the right number of topics chosen. The measure is computed in terms of symmetric KL-Divergence of salient distributions that are derived from these matrix factors. We observe that the divergence values are higher for non-optimal number of topics \textendash{} this is shown by a 'dip' at the right value for 't'.",

Domestic shows with toy lanterns allowed children to perform as curators, showmen, and audience members. This play naturalized such home entertainment as a commodifiable experience. Promotion of toy lanterns in the periodical The Youth's Companion from the 1880s to 1900s demonstrates the toy's function as an early children's home entertainment medium that has historically been overlooked in favor of analyses of the lantern as a mass medium in institutional contexts.",

Participation in technological fluency-building activities among high school students in a community heavily involved in the technology industry was investigated in a study of 98 high school seniors enrolled in AP-level calculus. Findings indicated substantial variability in history of fluencybuilding experiences despite similar levels of access. More and less experienced groups were defined based on their breadth of prior experience. Males and females who were classified as more experienced utilized a broader range of learning resources and were more likely to learn from out-of-school classes and distributed resources such as online tutorials and reading material. Gender differences emerged with respect to participation in certain activities such as computer programming, even when controlling for overall breadth of experience and an analysis of course-taking history helped explain why. Four times as many males as females had taken a programming class. Analysis of reasons for taking courses indicated that the majority of females who chose to take programming did so with the encouragement of family members. Both confidence and interest were related to experience, though the relationship differed for males and females.

In this paper we report findings of a remote diary study that captured 109 diverse families' experiences during the first wave of U.S. closures with the goal of understanding the ways in which families were adapting to remote learning. We address three main questions: (1) What learning partner roles did parents assume when schools transitioned to remote teaching and did they vary by family income level?; (2) How did these learning arrangements help families address the unique challenges they faced? and (3) Were there unexpected benefits? Our findings show how parents took on new roles by listening in on instruction, supervising learning, providing technical support, brokering connections, and collaborating. Benefits included new insights about what and how their children were learning.",

Along the way, two interventions were conducted in an Action Design Research style: one using Worked Examples, and another using Structured Small Groups. We report on the mixed results of these experiments, plus evaluations of the assignments from student surveys and statistical measures of item effectiveness.

They are generally assessed in school based on criteria such as the social impact conveyed, whether the projects work without errors, and whether they are creative and engaging. Additionally, researchers have assessed such projects based on the frequency of use of various coding constructs like variables, conditionals, and iterations. This paper presents a novel multidimensional rubric for analyzing open-ended BBP projects that integrates assessment of front-end project design and back-end sophistication of use of coding constructs. Further, the novelty of the rubric lies in the fact that instead of relying solely on frequencies, it uses scaled scores based on sophistication of rubric components. Using this rubric, 160 Scratch and App Inventor projects were scored and analyzed. The paper establishes external validity of the rubric and examines what we can learn about student learning from this analysis. Our findings will help K-12 CS educators and curriculum developers recognize what aspects of CS middle school students need most support on, and how to leverage programming environments to provide this support.",

My fieldwork took place between 2013 and 2017, just before a newly formed leftist political party gained power after a century of rule by Mexico's ``revolutionary'' party. For self-identified ``disenchanted'' youth in Mexico, skeptical of the promises of social mobility by means of formal education, ``hacking'' emerged as a way to make sense of their futures in a precarious state and economy and as a way to let their ``code work'' intervene in narratives that had only delivered false hopes. Coworking spaces, hackathons, entrepreneurial initiatives, and neoliberal ``reforms'' were seldom differentiated by politicians. By immersing themselves in the code that underlies the technologies that promise developmentalist change, I show how fundamental coding principles become good to think with, alongside the institutions and systems responsible for reinstating unequal opportunities, iteration after iteration. Hacker-entrepreneurs used their code work to develop heuristics for analyzing the organization of entities and relationship between them, whether they were elements in a coding environment or actors in a political-economic environment.

DADM safeguards can be very helpful for decision-support applications in fields such as banking or employment. However, constraining data mining to exclude a fixed enumeration of potentially discriminatory features is too restrictive. It should be complemented by exploratory DADM. We discuss these two forms of DADM and their requirements for evaluation, and we discuss and refine our DCUBE-GUI tool as a system for exploratory DADM. In a user study administered via Mechanical Turk, we show that tools such as DCUBE-GUI can successfully assist novice users in exploring discrimination in data mining.",

However, the understanding of this approach to learning and its outcomes remains incomplete. It remains unclear how situations influence the coconstruction of knowledge. This paper seeks to commence addressing this question through an analysis of the nature and possible cognitive consequences of situated learning. To engage in this analysis it is necessary to offer an initial reconciliation of aspects of cognitive and socio-cultural theorising. This reconciliation provides a basis to advance an account of how situations influence the co-construction of knowledge. It is held that individuals' participation-in-goal-directed activities is integral to a mutually transforming process of learning. Moreover, the situation and circumstances constitute a basis for understanding these activities and therefore cognition. Areas of compatibility between the two perspectives are first identified followed by a view of how social circumstances influence the reciprocal construction of knowledge using a review of the literature. Finally, an account of the likely cognitive consequences of situated learning and their sources is advanced."

We focus on how autistic people, family members, teachers, and advocates cast autistic characters in their fanfiction stories, how these stories represent autism and how, given the affordances of an online publishing platform, audience members respond to such representations. Findings suggest that these online narratives diversify available representations of autistic characters; moreover, the interactive nature of the online publishing forum allows readers to respond to and potentially disrupt stereotypical thinking and common fictional tropes surrounding autism.",

The issue of continuous under-representation for Black/African Americans is especially telling of a pressing digital divide issue. Members of this group comprise roughly 13\\\% of the U.S. population, but disproportionately hold only 5\\\% and 8\\\% of computer engineering and computer science bachelor's degrees. Studies suggest that computing culture and stereotypes associated with the discipline and its practitioners are among the varied contributors to sociocultural rifts between Black students and computing. This disconnect impacts students' computational and technological identities, which may result in these students deciding to ``disidentify'' with computing, and to pursue academic disciplines in which they experience higher self-efficacy. Despite comprising only 4\\\% of U.S. universities, Historically Black Colleges \\\& Universities (HBCUs) produce 31\\\% of the Black STEM bachelor's degrees. Still, HBCU computing departments face unique retention issues that impact student matriculation through computer science (CS) degrees. As there are few course-based efforts geared toward cultivating students' computing identities, this position paper highlights the need for formal attention to the fostering of these identities. It presents HBCU computing departments as key centers for beginning to address traditional computing culture and identity-related attrition issues for Black students. By tackling notions of computing and technology identity in these settings, students are given space to critique and develop their computational identities in ways that support retention in the CS major and degree completion.",

We analyzed the impact of teacher and student-level variables to determine the extent AP CS A course taking and exam passing differences existed between over- and under-represented populations. Our analyses suggest four prominent findings: (1) CPS, in collaboration with their Research-Practice Partnership (Chicago Alliance for Equity in Computer Science; CAF\'ECS), is broadening participation for students taking the AP CS A course; (2) Overand under-represented students took the AP CS A exam at statistically comparable rates, suggesting differential encouragement to take or not take the AP CS A exam was not prevalent among these demographics; (3) After adjusting for teacher and student-level prior experience, there were no significant differences among over- and under-represented racial categorizations in their likelihoods to pass the AP CS A exam, albeit Female students were 3.3 times less likely to pass the exam than Males overall; (4) Taking the Exploring Computer Science course before AP CS A predicted students being 3.5 times more likely to pass the AP CS A exam than students that did not take ECS before AP CS A. Implications are discussed around secondary computer science course sequencing and lines of inquiry to encourage even greater broadening of participation in the AP CS A course and passing of the AP CS A exam.",

    abstract = "There has been a worldwide surge in programming education initiatives for children and teenagers. In Brazil, this trend faces some challenges, namely inadequate infrastructure of most schools, notably public ones, that lack access to computers and tablets, and basic education curricular requirements not contemplating computer science concepts. This article reports on the five-year experience of an outreach project from a public university in Brazil. The project aims to promote computer science education and to teach programming to children and teenagers. Undergraduate engineering students who participate in the project as members engage in activities such as planning the courses and their schedules, creating partnerships with local schools and other educational projects, giving lectures, producing scientific research and educational materials, as well as promoting the project on social media. The courses use free online programming tools, Python, MIT App Inventor, and Arduino to cover fundamental concepts of programming and computational thinking. They vary approaches and tools according to the age range and available technological resources of the target audience. The use of unplugged activities means to assist in learning and to circumvent computer access problems.

Over its five-year existence, the project has achieved its purpose, by reaching a total of 2639 students through 45 workshops and 94 courses.

We conducted a constant comparative analysis (Glaser \\\& Strauss, 1967) using dual eye tracking video footage gathered across three experimental conditions (i.e., SGV, Head-Mounted Camera, Webcam). This paper supports a key finding from the larger study (i.e., SGVs help instructors track learner cognitive state), and its contribution goes one step further to identify a property of tracking cognitive state: Just-in-time support (described in findings section).

This article demonstrates that the re-embodiment of voice reasserted naturalized boundaries of gender and race in Hollywood `wigger' films from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s. The ideological effects of such representations both locally and more widely point to the importance of examining mediatized practices and products through a linguistic-anthropological lens.",

Several studies that measure the impact of teaching programming, analytical thinking, and CT have been conducted. In this review, we analyze and discuss findings from these studies and highlight the importance of learning programming with a focus on the development of CT skills at a young age. We also describe the tools that are available to improve the teaching of CT and provide a state-of-the-art overview of how programming is being taught at schools and universities in Colombia and around the world.",

Such independency restrictions occur naturally when the decision process leading to the labels in the data-set was biased; e.g., due to gender or racial discrimination. This setting is motivated by many cases in which there exist laws that disallow a decision that is partly based on discrimination. Naive application of machine learning techniques would result in huge fines for companies. We present three approaches for making the naive Bayes classifier discrimination-free: (i) modifying the probability of the decision being positive, (ii) training one model for every sensitive attribute value and balancing them, and (iii) adding a latent variable to the Bayesian model that represents the unbiased label and optimizing the model parameters for likelihood using expectation maximization. We present experiments for the three approaches on both artificial and real-life data.",

In the first part of the paper, we discuss why the topic is important in the high pressure environment that novice scholars face, in which finishing a doctoral degree and getting published can make a difference in career success or failure, and explain our understanding of theoretical/conceptual framing, including provisionally defining some key terms. We then elucidate ten problems that novice scholars have with theoretical/conceptual framing, using our own experiences as manuscript reviewers and writers as examples. The paper concludes with ways that novice scholars can address the task of framing their scholarly work conceptually and theoretically, on the understanding that the struggles continue over the lifetime of a scholarly career.",

Research in psychological science has provided answers to many of these questions but, somewhat surprisingly, this research has been slow to make inroads into educational policy and practice. Instead, the field has been plagued by decades of ``reading wars.'' Even now, there remains a wide gap between the state of research knowledge about learning to read and the state of public understanding. The aim of this article is to fill this gap. We present a comprehensive tutorial review of the science of learning to read, spanning from children's earliest alphabetic skills through to the fluent word recognition and skilled text comprehension characteristic of expert readers. We explain why phonics instruction is so central to learning in a writing system such as English. But we also move beyond phonics, reviewing research on what else children need to learn to become expert readers and considering how this might be translated into effective classroom practice. We call for an end to the reading wars and recommend an agenda for instruction and research in reading acquisition that is balanced, developmentally informed, and based on a deep understanding of how language and writing systems work.",

In this edited volume, the authors argue that past practice is inadequate and issue a mandate for a new approach to educator preparation. Articulating a clear definition of community-engaged teacher preparation, they focus on national and international initiatives that have been sustained over time and are having a direct impact on student learning. Chapters are written by school, university, and community partners who speak to the innovation, creativity, commitment, and persistence required to reinvent teacher preparation. They also underscore the complexity of this work, the humility necessary to reflect and reconsider, and the true spirit of authentic solidarity among university, school, and community partners required to seek and secure equity for children in schools. Book Features: Provides a critical examination of structural inequity in education and ways to address it through community-engaged teacher preparation; Describes a teacher preparation model that is enacted in solidarity with members of historically marginalized populations; Offers clear guidance on what is meant by culturally relevant and culturally sustaining pedagogies with examples of how these frameworks are being operationalized; Explores the obstacles and opportunities involved in the implementation process",

Therefore, the ways in which cooperating teachers participate in teacher education are significant. This review seeks to move conceptions of that participation beyond commonly held beliefs to empirically supported claims. The analysis draws on Brodie, Cowling, and Nissen's notion of categories of participation to generate 11 different ways that cooperating teachers participate in teacher education: as Providers of Feedback, Gatekeepers of the Profession, Modelers of Practice, Supporters of Reflection, Gleaners of Knowledge, Purveyors of Context, Conveners of Relation, Agents of Socialization, Advocates of the Practical, Abiders of Change, and Teachers of Children. When set against Gaventa's typology of participation, the resultant grid highlights the importance of negotiated or invited spaces for cooperating teacher participation and provides a new way of thinking about, planning professional development for, and working with cooperating teachers.",

Yet, there is a global disparity in where youth are learning programming, with the majority of computing instruction occurring in developed countries and urban areas, if it occurs at all in developing countries. In this work, we sought to counteract this trend by bringing computing, specifically physical computing in the form of robotics, to youth and young adults in rural El Salvador. In this paper, we present the robotics activities completed with youth in a small, Salvadoran community. Based on field notes of the activities and interviews with the youth who participated, we present both the successes and difficulties we faced carrying out this educational outreach program. We further explore the challenges faced due to this unique environment and lessons learned that can help inform the expansion of computing opportunities in developing nations.",

    abstract = "The nascent field of fair machine learning aims to ensure that decisions guided by algorithms are equitable. Over the last several years, three formal definitions of fairness have gained prominence: (1) anti-classification, meaning that protected attributes\textemdash like race, gender, and their proxies\textemdash are not explicitly used to make decisions; (2) classification parity, meaning that common measures of predictive performance (e.g., false positive and false negative rates) are equal across groups defined by the protected attributes; and (3) calibration, meaning that conditional on risk estimates, outcomes are independent of protected attributes. Here we show that all three of these fairness definitions suffer from significant statistical limitations. Requiring anticlassification or classification parity can, perversely, harm the very groups they were designed to protect; and calibration, though generally desirable, provides little guarantee that decisions are equitable. In contrast to these formal fairness criteria, we argue that it is often preferable to treat similarly risky people similarly, based on the most statistically accurate estimates of risk that one can produce. Such a strategy, while not universally applicable, often aligns well with policy objectives; notably, this strategy will typically violate both anti-classification and classification parity. In practice, it requires significant effort to construct suitable risk estimates. One must carefully define and measure the targets of prediction to avoid retrenching biases in the data. But, importantly, one cannot generally address these difficulties by requiring that algorithms satisfy popular mathematical formalizations of fairness. By highlighting these challenges in the foundation of fair machine learning, we hope to help researchers and practitioners productively advance the area.",

    abstract = "Computational thinking (CT) is regarded as an essential twenty-first century competency and it is already embedded in K-12 curricula across the globe. However, research on assessing CT has lagged, with few assessments being implemented and validated. Moreover, there is a lack of systematic grouping of CT assessments. This scoping review examines 39 empirical studies published within the last five years, coded by the specific competencies outlined in existing CT frameworks, to identify and classify the key features of existing CT assessments. Results show that most studies target K-12 settings, focus on interventions that promote CT concepts and practices, adopt a quasi-experimental design, use selected-response items as the dominant testing form, and mainly assess algorithmic thinking, abstraction, problem decomposition, logical thinking, and data. Finally, few CT assessments have been validated in educational settings. Implications include identifying gaps in the CT assessment literature, deepening our understanding of the nature of CT, focusing on the validation of CT assessments, and guiding researchers and practitioners in choosing developmentally appropriate CT assessments. Cognitive and educational implications for future research inquiry include the development of new assessment tools that comprehensively assess CT and its relation to learning.",

We find that people make a surprisingly rich set of social inferences from the networked activity information in GitHub, such as inferring someone else's technical goals and vision when they edit code, or guessing which of several similar projects has the best chance of thriving in the long term.

    abstract = {Understanding social interaction within groups is key to analyzing online communities. Most current work focuses on structural properties: who talks to whom, and how such interactions form larger network structures. The interactions themselves, however, generally take place in the form of natural language --- either spoken or written --- and one could reasonably suppose that signals manifested in language might also provide information about roles, status, and other aspects of the group's dynamics. To date, however, finding such domain-independent language-based signals has been a challenge. Here, we show that in group discussions power differentials between participants are subtly revealed by how much one individual immediately echoes the linguistic style of the person they are responding to. Starting from this observation, we propose an analysis framework based on linguistic coordination that can be used to shed light on power relationships and that works consistently across multiple types of power --- including a more "static" form of power based on status differences, and a more "situational" form of power in which one individual experiences a type of dependence on another. Using this framework, we study how conversational behavior can reveal power relationships in two very different settings: discussions among Wikipedians and arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court.},

For example, observing classroom cues that assist teachers in identifying which students may require further instruction and mediation. Resources which evaluate the way students are utilising the online tools and interacting with each other have, to date, been largely neglected, thus there are limited resources for teachers to access ongoing and informal learning indicators within the online environment. As a result, the online education environment has suffered from a lack of readily available learning-progress data that can assist teaching staff in designing learning activities, and assessing and identifying individuals requiring early learning interventions.",

We describe the dangers to democratic decision-making when high-performance algorithms fail to provide an explicit account of causation. We then demonstrate how information theory allows us to degrade predictions so that they decorrelate from protected variables with minimal loss of accuracy. Enforcing total decorrelation is at best a near-term solution, however. The role of causal argument in ethical debate urges the development of new, interpretable machine-learning algorithms that reference causal mechanisms.",

We show that segregated interaction is amplified relative to the expected effects of geographic segregation in terms of both shopping activity and online communication. Furthermore, we find that segregation increases with difference in socio-economic status but is asymmetric, i.e., the amount of interaction from poorer to wealthier neighborhoods is considerably larger than vice versa. Our results provide novel insights into the understanding of behavioral segregation in human interactions with significant socio-political and economic implications.",

We also present an adaptation of our approach to achieve the complementary goal of ``fair affirmative action,'' which guarantees statistical parity (i.e., the demographics of the set of individuals receiving any classification are the same as the demographics of the underlying population), while treating similar individuals as similarly as possible. Finally, we discuss the relationship of fairness to privacy: when fairness implies privacy, and how tools developed in the context of differential privacy may be applied to fairness.",

These methods generally produce low-quality topical phrases or suffer from poor scalability on even moderately-sized datasets. We propose a different approach that is both computationally efficient and effective. Our solution combines a novel phrase mining framework to segment a document into single and multi-word phrases, and a new topic model that operates on the induced document partition. Our approach discovers high quality topical phrases with negligible extra cost to the bag-of-words topic model in a variety of datasets including research publication titles, abstracts, reviews, and news articles.",

The curriculum was designed to integrate music, literacy, and design with engineering and robotics. Children (N = 64) from seven preschool classrooms, ranging in age from 3 to 5, participated in the study. Findings indicated that children as young as age 3 could create syntactically correct programs for the KIBO robot, although older preschoolers (closer to age 5) performed better than younger preschoolers on a standardized programming task. Additionally, all students generally performed better on the programming tasks that required them to manipulate less programming instructions.

Video games have become one of the fastest growing forms of media for youth and adult consumers. Minecraft, a multiplayer online game (MOG), is one of the most popular video games to date. By allowing its players to build simulated, virtual worlds, Minecraft aims to foster creativity, control, and imagination. Yet while the affordances of playing Minecraft spark collaborative learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills among youth, one constraint still remains: there appears to be a disconnect between some teachers' and parents' understandings about the Minecraft world's mechanisms, uses, and benefits. Due to the success of Minecraft in the digital era and in some schools, studying this game is significant. For instance, students benefit from using Minecraft to enhance learning in STEM/STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, [Arts], and Math) and English Language Arts content areas. In addition, teachers benefit from using Minecraft to increase academic engagement with students and reinforce parental involvement. This article (a) provides an examination of educational research on the use of Minecraft in classrooms; (b) suggests educational benefits for students and practical classroom approaches for teachers from various disciplines; and (c) presents a handout for teachers to share with parents about what they need to know and use to support their children's literacy practices and learning while playing Minecraft.",

We first demonstrate that the classical sociology of intellectuals was centered on a problematic of allegiance that no longer seems productive. In addition, we show that by focusing on a particular social type it remained limited to only one mode of intervention into the public sphere. We then review two literatures that distance themselves from the classical problematic and that could be integrated under the common rubric of a sociology of interventions: The first literature analyzes intellectual fields and markets. It moves away from the sociology of intellectuals by multiplying the relevant actors and depersonalizing the term ``intellectual'' so that it no longer stands for a social type but for the capacity to make a public intervention, a capacity to which many different actors lay claim. The second literature analyzes the public deployment of expertise. It multiplies not simply the actors laying claim to the mantle of the intellectual, but the formats and modes of intervention itself, i.e., the different ways in which knowledge and expertise can be inserted into the public sphere.",

We have implemented, used and refined this system since 2009 for growing student numbers, and summarise the design and experience of using it. The core idea is to use a unit testing framework: the teacher creates a set of unit tests, and the student code is tested by running these tests. With our implementation, students typically submit work for assessment, and receive feedback by email within a few minutes after submission. The choice of tests and the reporting back to the student is chosen to optimise the educational value for the students. The system very significantly reduces the staff time required to establish whether a student's solution is correct, and shifts the emphasis of computing laboratory student contact time from assessing correctness to providing guidance. The self-paced nature of the automatic feedback provision supports a student-centred learning approach. Students can re-submit their work repeatedly and iteratively improve their solution, and enjoy using the system. We include an evaluation of the system and data from using it in a class of 425 students.",

Although such statistics are semantically informative, they disregard the valuable information that is contained in semantic lexicons such as WordNet, FrameNet, and the Paraphrase Database. This paper proposes a method for refining vector space representations using relational information from semantic lexicons by encouraging linked words to have similar vector representations, and it makes no assumptions about how the input vectors were constructed. Evaluated on a battery of standard lexical semantic evaluation tasks in several languages, we obtain substantial improvements starting with a variety of word vector models. Our refinement method outperforms prior techniques for incorporating semantic lexicons into word vector training algorithms.",

In the context of online social learning, it takes into account both formal and informal educational environments, including networks and communities. The paper introduces the broad rationale for SLA by reviewing some of the key drivers that make social learning so important today. Five forms of SLA are identified, including those which are inherently social, and others which have social dimensions. The paper goes on to describe early work towards implementing these analytics on SocialLearn, an online learning space in use at the UK's Open University, and the challenges that this is raising. This work takes an iterative approach to analytics, encouraging learners to respond to and help to shape not only the analytics but also their associated recommendations.",

After a short introductory experiential game the children were involved in solving a series of analogous computer programming problems, using a Logo-based environment on an Interactive White Board. The intervention was designed as a part of the structured learning activities of the kindergarten which are teacher-guided and are conducted in a whole-class social mode. The observation of the video recording of the intervention along with the analysis of teacher's interview and the researcher's notes allow for a realistic evaluation of the feasibility, the appropriateness and the learning value of integrating computer programming in such a context. The research evidence supports the view that children enjoyed the engaging learning activities and had opportunities to develop mathematical concepts, problem solving and social skills. Interesting results about children learning, difficulties, interactions, problem solving strategies and the teacher's role are reported.

Those who subscribe to these approaches conceptualize standardized linguistic practices as an objective set of linguistic forms that are appropriate for an academic setting. In contrast, Flores and Rosa highlight the raciolinguistic ideologies through which racialized bodies come to be constructed as engaging in appropriately academic linguistic practices. Drawing on theories of language ideologies and racialization, they offer a perspective from which students classified as long-term English learners, heritage language learners, and Standard English learners can be understood to inhabit a shared racial positioning that frames their linguistic practices as deficient regardless of how closely they follow supposed rules of appropriateness. The authors illustrate how appropriateness-based approaches to language education are implicated in the reproduction of racial normativity by expecting language-minoritized students to model their linguistic practices after the white speaking subject despite the fact that the white listening subject continues to perceive their language use in racialized ways. They conclude with a call for reframing language diversity in education away from a discourse of appropriateness toward one that seeks to denaturalize standardized linguistic categories.",

This model highlights a dialectic between construction and critique of claims in both scientific reasoning and practice. A ``grasp'' of scientific practice as such is instrumental to learning because informational content of scientific knowledge lies not only on the level of facts, but also on the levels of methods and values, and coordinating information across these levels is crucial for understanding. In contrast to prevailing constructivist ideas that highlight student authority to construct knowledge as scientists do, this model emphasizes the importance of knowing how to hold claims accountable. Thus, the ideal vision of students making their own sense of content is superceded by a more defensible ideal vision of students learning how to make scientific sense of content. \textcopyright{} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Qualitative research in the history and sociology of science suggests that this choice is patterned by an ``essential tension'' between productive tradition and risky innovation. We examine this tension through Bourdieu's field theory of science, and we explore it empirically by analyzing millions of biomedical abstracts from MEDLINE. We represent the evolving state of chemical knowledge with networks extracted from these abstracts. We then develop a typology of research strategies on these networks. Scientists can introduce novel chemicals and chemical relationships (innovation) or delve deeper into known ones (tradition). They can consolidate knowledge clusters or bridge them. The aggregate distribution of published strategies remains remarkably stable. High-risk innovation strategies are rare and reflect a growing focus on established knowledge. An innovative publication is more likely to achieve high impact than a conservative one, but the additional reward does not compensate for the risk of failing to publish. By studying prizewinners in biomedicine and chemistry, we show that occasional gambles for extraordinary impact are a compelling explanation for observed levels of risky innovation. Our analysis of the essential tension identifies institutional forces that sustain tradition and suggests policy interventions to foster innovation.",

Currently, little is known about how best to sequence computer science learning across elementary grades. In this paper, we present an analysis of 123 students' (age 9-12, grades 4-6) activities in a curriculum implemented in a visual block-based programming language. The goal of this work is to better understand the developmental appropriateness of foundational computer science ideas. All 4th, 5th, and 6th grade students in a single school completed the first module of a curriculum during the same school year with the same instructor. We analyzed each task students attempted and found that for simple concepts, there was little difference in performance between grade levels. However, differences were found for more complex topics, such as whether they completed initialization tasks and the way in which they solved 2-d navigation tasks. A closer look revealed that students understood the basic concepts, but were challenged by deeper applications of the basic concepts and influenced by non-computer science skills. This work serves as an empirically grounded investigation of elementary computer science learning and contributes to our understanding of computer science learning trajectories and concept sequencing in the late elementary grades.",

The importance of journal publication in academic promotion makes it a highly personal issue, since focusing exclusively on journal papers misses many significant papers published by CS conferences. Here, we aim to quantify the relative importance of CS journal and conference papers, showing that CS papers in leading conferences match the impact of papers in mid-ranking journals and surpass the impact of papers in journals in the bottom half of the Thompson Reuters rankings (http://www.isiknowledge.com) for impact measured in terms of citations in Google Scholar. We also show that poor correlation between this measure and conference acceptance rates indicates conference publication is an inefficient market where venues equally challenging in terms of rejection rates offer quite different returns in terms of citations. How to measure the quality of academic research and performance of particular researchers has always involved debate. Many CS researchers feel that performance assessment is an exercise in futility, in part because academic research cannot be boiled down to a set of simple performance metrics, and any attempt to introduce them would expose the entire research enterprise to manipulation and gaming. On the other hand, many researchers want some reasonable way to evaluate academic performance, arguing that even an imperfect system sheds light on research quality, helping funding agencies and tenure committees make more informed decisions. One long-standing way of evaluating academic performance is through publication output. Best practice for academics is to write key research contributions as scholarly articles for submission to relevant journals and conferences; the peer-review model has stood the test of time in determining the quality of accepted articles. However, today's culture of academic publication accommodates a range of publication opportunities yielding a continuum of quality, with a significant gap between the lower and upper reaches of the continuum; for example, journal papers are routinely viewed as superior to conference papers, which are generally considered superior to papers at workshops and local symposia. Several techniques are used for evaluating publications and publication outlets, mostly targeting journals. For example, Thompson Reuters (the Institute for Scientific Information) and other such organizations record and assess the number of citations accumulated by leading journals (and some high-ranking conferences) in the ISI Web of Knowledge (http://www.isiknowledge.com) to compute the impact factor of a journal as a measure of its ability to attract citations. Less-reliable indicators of publication quality are also available for judging conference quality; for example, a conference's rejection rate is often cited as a quality indicator on the grounds that a high rejection rate means a more selective review process able to generate higher-quality papers. However, as the devil is in the details, the details in this case vary among academic disciplines and subdisciplines. Here, we examine the issue of publication quality from a CS/engineering perspective, describing how related publication practices differ from those of other disciplines, in that CS/engineering research is mainly published in conferences rather than in journals. This culture presents an important challenge when evaluating CS research because traditional impact metrics are better suited to evaluating journal rather than conference publications. In order to legitimize the role of conference papers to the wider scientific community, we offer an impact measure based on an analysis of Google Scholar citation data suited to CS conferences. We validate this new measure with a large-scale experiment covering 8,764 conference and journal papers to demonstrate a strong correlation between traditional journal impact and our new citation score. The results highlight how leading conferences compare favorably to mid-ranking journals, surpassing the impact of journals in the bottom half of the traditional ISI Web of Knowledge ranking. We also discuss a number of interesting anomalies in the CS conference circuit, highlighting how conferences with similar rejection rates (the traditional way of evaluating conferences) can attract quite different citation counts. We also note interesting geographical distinctions in this regard, particularly with respect to European and U.S. conferences.",

There is a danger, however, in thinking that with enough data, the numbers speak for themselves. In fact, with larger amounts of data, theory plays an ever-more critical role in analysis. In this introduction to the special section on learning analytics and learning theory, we describe some critical problems in the analysis of large-scale data that occur when theory is not involved. These questions revolve around what variables a researcher should attend to and how to interpret a multitude of micro-results and make them actionable. We conclude our comments with a discussion of how the collection of empirical papers included in the special section, and the commentaries that were invited on them, speak to these challenges, and in doing so represent important steps towards theory-informed and theory-contributing learning analytics work. Our ultimate goal is to provoke a critical dialogue in the field about the ways in which learning analytics research draws on and contributes to theory.",

On the basis of deep personal experience and extensive field-work research, we challenge prevailing assumptions about language, bilingualism, and edu\- cation that are based on raciolinguistic ideologies with roots in colonialism. Adopting a translanguaging perspective that rejects rigid colonial boundaries of named languages, we argue that racialized bilingual learners, like all students, draw from linguistic-semiotic, cultural, and historical repertoires. The decolonial approach that guides our work reveals these stu\- dents making a world by means of cultural and linguistic prac\- tices derived from their own knowledge systems. We propose that in order to attain justice and success, a decolonial educa\- tion must center non-hegemonic modes of ``otherwise thinking'' by attending to racialized bilinguals' knowledges and abilities that have always existed yet have continually been distorted and erased through abyssal thinking.",

We focus on a specific scientific breakthrough, the theory of evolution through natural selection by Charles Darwin, and examine the diffusion of certain key concepts that characterized this theory in the broader cultural discourse and social imaginary. We find that some concepts in Darwin's theory, such as Evolution, Survival, Natural Selection and Competition diffused in the cultural discourse immediately after the publication of On the Origins of Species. Other concepts such as Selection and Adaptation were already present in the cultural dialogue. Moreover, we document semantic changes for most of these concepts over time. Our findings thus show a complex relation between two key factors of long-term economic growth \textendash{} science and culture. Considering the evolution of these two factors jointly can offer new insights to the study of the determinants of economic development, and machine learning is a promising tool to explore these relationships."

    abstract = "A recurring theme in sociological research is the tradeoff between fitting in and standing out. Prior work examining this tension has tended to take either a network structural or a cultural perspective. We instead fuse these two traditions to develop a theory of how structural and cultural embeddedness jointly relate to individual attainment within organizations. Given that organizational culture is hard to observe, we develop a novel approach to assessing individuals' cultural fit with their colleagues in an organization based on the language expressed in internal email communications. Drawing on a unique data set that includes a corpus of 10.25 million email messages exchanged over five years among 601 employees in a high-technology firm, we find that network constraint impedes, while cultural fit promotes, individual attainment. More importantly, we find evidence of a tradeoff between the two forms of embeddedness: cultural fit benefits individuals with low network constraint (i.e., brokers), while network constraint promotes attainment for those with low cultural fit.",

Although these approaches are generally not contradictory, they are not always consistent.

Our goal in this paper is to connect these literatures with an eye towards offering a design heuristic for mathematics educators interested in accounting for students' identity development in mathematics teaching and learning. To do so, we present a model of mathematical identities as they are realized in the classroom, articulate the elements involved in the development of such an identity, and then use the model to analyze approaches to intervene in classroom systems by focusing on different elements as starting points.",

Past research conducted in the context of text-based programming points to several challenges related to novice learners' understanding of foundational programming constructs such as variables, loops, and expressions. This research aims to develop assessment items for measuring student understanding in introductory CS classrooms in middle school using a principled approach for assessment design. This paper describes the design of assessments items that were piloted with 100 6th, 7th, 8th graders who had completed an introductory programming course using Scratch. The results and follow-up cognitive thinkalouds indicate that students are generally unfamiliar with the use of variables, and harbor misconceptions about them. They also have trouble with other aspects of introductory programming such as how loops work, and how the Boolean operators work. These findings point to the need for pedagogy that combines popular constructionist activities with those that target conceptual learning, along with better professional development to support teachers' conceptual learning of these foundational constructs.",

Multi-level analyses revealed that students in both studies (1) achieved substantial learning gains in algorithmic thinking skills and significant growth towards a more mature understanding of computing as a discipline, and (2) found certain CT ideas and constructs more difficult than others. Prior computing experiences and math and English ability were found to be predictors of learning outcomes. Extracurricular experiences with technology also appeared to impact outcomes.",

Next, we expand this theory by proposing four indicia of the transformative nature of becoming historical actors, and offer three empirical examples to elucidate them. In our first vignette, we document how, when youth glitch during video game play, they collectively experiment with the rules, regulations, and boundaries of game design, finding ways to circumvent normative video game play and co-author their experiences. In the second vignette, we focus on siblings who take over research video cameras as their family is being filmed. We illustrate how they reshape their relation to the cameras, reorganizing participation structures through their agentive and transgressive actions. Finally, we offer an example from viral media to consider how we might recognize the process of becoming historical actors in the research that youth themselves conduct when they leverage digital tools to document everyday acts of racism, and, importantly, resistance.",

Although studies in computing education have documented the barriers that non-native English speakers face while learning CS using online programming platforms, little research has been done on their experiences in CS courses within a university setting. In this study, we seek to understand the experiences of non-native English speakers learning CS at a English-speaking university in the United States. Through weekly surveys and course grades from four CS courses, we investigate the differences between non-native and native English speakers with respect to the time spent studying outside of class, confidence levels at the start of a course, types of learning resources used, and expected and actual overall grades. We found that although non-native speakers require a higher minimum grade to be satisfied and often spend a longer time on average studying outside of class compared to native speakers, there was no difference in the actual grade received between the two groups. While there was no significant difference in the type of resources used (online vs in-person), there was a significant difference in the confidence level between native and non-native English speakers.",

There are, however, negative social perceptions about data mining, among which potential privacy invasion and potential discrimination. The latter consists of unfairly treating people on the basis of their belonging to a specific group. Automated data collection and data mining techniques such as classification rule mining have paved the way to making automated decisions, like loan granting/denial, insurance premium computation, etc. If the training data sets are biased in what regards discriminatory (sensitive) attributes like gender, race, religion, etc., discriminatory decisions may ensue. For this reason, antidiscrimination techniques including discrimination discovery and prevention have been introduced in data mining. Discrimination can be either direct or indirect. Direct discrimination occurs when decisions are made based on sensitive attributes. Indirect discrimination occurs when decisions are made based on nonsensitive attributes which are strongly correlated with biased sensitive ones. In this paper, we tackle discrimination prevention in data mining and propose new techniques applicable for direct or indirect discrimination prevention individually or both at the same time. We discuss how to clean training data sets and outsourced data sets in such a way that direct and/or indirect discriminatory decision rules are converted to legitimate (nondiscriminatory) classification rules. We also propose new metrics to evaluate the utility of the proposed approaches and we compare these approaches. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed techniques are effective at removing direct and/or indirect discrimination biases in the original data set while preserving data quality.",

As part of this effort, we have investigated for the first time the problem of discrimination and privacy aware frequent pattern discovery, i.e. the sanitization of the collection of patterns mined from a transaction database in such a way that neither privacy-violating nor discriminatory inferences can be inferred on the released patterns. Moreover, we investigate the problem of discrimination and privacy aware data publishing, i.e. transforming the data, instead of patterns, in order to simultaneously fulfill privacy preservation and discrimination prevention.",

Indeed, banks, large corporations, insurance companies, casinos, etc. are increasingly mining data about their customers or employees in view of detecting potential intrusion, fraud or even crime. Mining algorithms are trained from datasets which may be biased in what regards gender, race, religion or other attributes. Furthermore, mining is often outsourced or carried out in cooperation by several entities. For those reasons, discrimination concerns arise. Potential intrusion, fraud or crime should be inferred from objective misbehavior, rather than from sensitive attributes like gender, race or religion. This paper discusses how to clean training datasets and outsourced datasets in such a way that legitimate classification rules can still be extracted but discriminating rules based on sensitive attributes cannot.",

We then use this methodology to reveal statistical laws of semantic evolution. Using six historical corpora spanning four languages and two centuries, we propose two quantitative laws of semantic change: (i) the law of conformity\textemdash the rate of semantic change scales with an inverse power-law of word frequency; (ii) the law of innovation\textemdash independent of frequency, words that are more polysemous have higher rates of semantic change.",

    abstract = "We study the effects of various types of education and training on the productivity of teachers in promoting student achievement. Previous studies on the subject have been hampered by inadequate measures of teacher training and difficulties in addressing the non-random selection of teachers to students and of teachers to training. We address these issues by estimating models that include detailed measures of pre-service and inservice training, a rich set of time-varying covariates, and student, teacher, and school fixed effects. We find that elementary and middle school teacher productivity increases with experience (informal on-the-job training). The largest gains from experience occur in the first few years, but we find continuing gains beyond the first five years of a teacher's career. In contrast, we do not find a consistent relationship between formal professional development training and teacher productivity. However, this may be partly driven by estimation issues as we find more significant positive effects of formal training in the subject-grade combination where estimates should be most precise (middle school math). There is no evidence that teachers' pre-service (undergraduate) training or college entrance exam scores are related to productivity.",

Drawing on understandings from architecture and urban design, as well as from our own research findings, we highlight the critical distinction between ``space'' and ``place''. While designers use spatial models to support interaction, we show how it is actually a notion of ``place'' which frames interactive behaviour. This leads us to re-evaluate spatial systems, and discuss how ``place'', rather than ``space'', can support CSCW design.",

The research question How can debugging as part of teaching and learning programming be understood as multimodal learning? has guided the analysis and the presentation of the data. In this study, and its analysis process, we have combined a multimodal understanding of teaching and learning practices with understandings of programming and how it is practiced. Consequently, the multidisciplinary approach in this study, combining theories from social sciences with theories and concepts from computer science, is central throughout the article. This is therefore also a creative, explorative process as there are no clear norms to follow when conducting multidisciplinary analyses. The data consist of video recordings of teaching sessions with children and a teacher engaged in programming activities. The video material was recorded in a preschool setting during the school year 2017\textendash 2018 and consists of 25 sessions of programming activities with children, who were four or five years old. The results show how debugging in early childhood education is a multimodal activity socially established by use of speech, pointing and gaze. Our findings also indicate that artefacts are central to learning debugging, and a term `instructional artefacts' is therefore added. Finally, the material shows how basic programming concepts and principles can be explored with young children.",

To explore how, we present a model for explanations based on the user's conceptual model of the recommendation process.

We reimagined grading, assessment, and testing in an extended program of design-based research using situative theory to refine online courses in secondary, undergraduate, graduate, and technical contexts. This research minimized private instructor-student interactions (including grading and private formative feedback) while maximizing public interactions. We present 10 assessment design principles, including a new principle concerning diversity and equity. We assume that these principles will be new to many readers and counter-intuitive to some. These principles focus on assessment func\- tions (rather than ostensible purposes) and align learning across increasingly formal levels. We argue that doing so can maximize formative and transformative assessment functions, position students as authors, rather than consumers, reposition minoritized students to empower them, and increase validity and credibility of evidence.",

    abstract = "This article explores the complex question of how instruction should be framed (i.e., contextualized). Reports from the US National Research Council reveal a broad consensus among experts that most instruction should be framed with problems, examples, cases, and illustrations. Such framing is assumed to help learners connect new knowledge to broader ``real world'' knowledge, motivate continued engagement, and ensure that learners can transfer their new knowledge to subsequent contexts. However, different theories of learning lead to different assumptions about when such frames should be introduced and how such frames should be created. This article shows how contemporary situative theories of learning argue that frames should be (a) introduced before instructional content, (b) generated by learners themselves, (c) used to make connections with people, places, topics, and times beyond the boundaries of the course, and (d) used to position learners as authors who hold themselves and their peers accountable for their participation in disciplinary discourse. This expansive approach to framing promises to support engagement with disciplinary content that is productive (i.e., increasingly sophisticated, raising new questions, recognizing confusion, making new connections, etc.) and generative (i.e., supporting transferable learning that is likely to be useful and used in a wide range of subsequent educational, professional, achievement, and personal contexts). A framework called Participatory Learning and Assessment (PLA) is presented that embeds expansively framed engagement within multiple levels of increasing formal assessments. This paper first summarizes PLA as theory-laden design principles. It then presents PLA as fourteen more prescriptive steps that some may find easier to implement, allowing them to learn as they go. Examples are presented from several courses from an extended program of design-based research using this approach in online and hybrid secondary, undergraduate, graduate, and technical courses.",

    abstract = "John Dewey (1859\textendash 1952) was one of American pragmatism'searly founders, along with Charles Sanders Peirce and William James,and arguably the most prominent American intellectual for the firsthalf of the twentieth century. Dewey's educational theories andexperiments had a global reach, his psychological theories had asizable influence in that growing science, and his writings aboutdemocratic theory and practice deeply influenced debates in academicand practical quarters for decades. In addition, Dewey developedextensive and often systematic views in ethics, epistemology, logic,metaphysics, aesthetics, and philosophy of religion. Because Deweytypically took a genealogical approach that couched his own viewwithin the larger history of philosophy, one may also find a fullydeveloped metaphilosophy in his work., Dewey's pragmatism\textemdash or, ``cultural naturalism'',which he favored over ``pragmatism'' and``instrumentalism''\textemdash may be understood as a critiqueand reconstruction of philosophy within the larger ambit of aDarwinian worldview (Lamont 1961; MW4: 3). Following James'lead, Dewey argued that philosophy had become an overly technical andintellectualistic discipline, divorced from assessing the socialconditions and values dominating everyday life (FAE, LW5:157\textendash 58). He sought to reconnect philosophy with the mission ofeducation-for-living (philosophy as ``the general theory ofeducation''), a form of social criticism at the most generallevel, or ``criticism of criticisms'' (EN, LW1:298; see also DE, MW9: 338)., Set within the larger picture of Darwinian evolutionary theory,philosophy should be seen as an activity undertaken by interdependentorganisms-in-environments. This standpoint, of active adaptation, ledDewey to criticize the tendency of traditional philosophies toabstract and reify concepts derived from living contexts. As did otherclassical pragmatists, Dewey focused criticism upon traditionaldualisms of metaphysics and epistemology (e.g., mind/body,nature/culture, self/society, and reason/emotion) and thenreconstructed their elements as parts of larger continuities. Forexample, human thinking is not a phenomenon which is radically outsideof (or external to) the world it seeks to know; knowing isnot a purely rational attempt to escape illusion in order todiscover what is ultimately ``real'' or ``true''.Rather, human knowing is among the ways organisms withevolved capacities for thought and language cope with problems. Minds,then, are not passively observing the world; rather, they are activelyadapting, experimenting, and innovating; ideas and theories are notrational fulcrums to get us beyond culture, but rather functionexperimentally within culture and are evaluated on situated, pragmaticbases. Knowing is not the mortal's exercise of a ``divinespark'', either; for while knowing (or inquiry, to useDewey's term) includes calculative or rational elements, it isultimately informed by the body and emotions of the animal using it tocope., In addition to academic life, Dewey comfortably wore the mantle ofpublic intellectual, infusing public issues with lessons found throughphilosophy. He spoke on topics of broad moral significance, such ashuman freedom, economic alienation, race relations, women'ssuffrage, war and peace, human freedom, and educational goals andmethods. Typically, discoveries made via public inquiries wereintegrated back into his academic theories, and aided their revision.This practice-theory-practice rhythm powered every area ofDewey's intellectual enterprise, and perhaps explains why hisphilosophical theories are still discussed, criticized, adapted, anddeployed in many academic and practical arenas. Use of Dewey'sideas continues apace in aesthetics and art criticism, education,environmental policy, information theory, journalism, medicine,political theory, psychiatry, public administration, sociology, and ofcourse in the philosophical areas to which Dewey contributed."

By reflecting climate risk in prices, markets can discourage excessive development in hazardous areas. However, the extent to which markets price these risks remains poorly understood. Here we measure the effect of information about flood risk contained in regulatory floodplain maps on residential property values in the United States. Using multiple empirical approaches and two decades of sales data covering the universe of homes in the United States, we find little evidence that housing markets fully price information about flood risk in aggregate. However, the price penalty is larger for commercial buyers and in markets where buyers are more risk aware, suggesting that policies to improve risk communication could influence market outcomes. Our findings indicate that houses in flood zones in the United States are currently overvalued by a total of \$43.8 billion (95\\\% confidence interval: \$32.6 to \$55.6 billion) based on the information in publicly available flood hazard maps alone, raising concerns about the stability of real estate markets as climate risks become more salient and severe.",

For this purpose we have started the development of a specific framework that, at the end, should reflect all factors that might be relevant for CSE. We collected five extensive case studies from five different countries and performed a qualitative text analysis on those, which was guided by the categories of the well-known Berlin Model as an initial theory. During the coding process we had to realize that this theory was not sufficient in many respects. At first, we noted that we had to deal with three different dimensions. Additionally, we found that we would need more categories, up to 70 at the end. The result of our coding process represents a first step towards the desired framework, that of course, has to be improved still a lot. This will be done by coding further case studies, extending, defining and explicating the categories.",

We argue and demonstrate that this is problematic for 3 reasons: the lack of a general definition of causal mediation effects independent of a particular statistical model, the inability to specify the key identification assumption, and the difficulty of extending the framework to nonlinear models. In this article, we propose an alternative approach that overcomes these limitations. Our approach is general because it offers the definition, identification, estimation, and sensitivity analysis of causal mediation effects without reference to any specific statistical model. Further, our approach explicitly links these 4 elements closely together within a single framework. As a result, the proposed framework can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and nonparametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. The general definition and identification result also allow us to develop sensitivity analysis in the context of commonly used models, which enables applied researchers to formally assess the robustness of their empirical conclusions to violations of the key assumption. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the Job Search Intervention Study. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all our proposed methods.",

To be successful in a changing economy, students must learn to think algorithmically and computationally, to solve problems with varying levels of abstraction. These computational thinking skills have become so integrated into social function as to represent fundamental literacies. However, computer science has not been widely taught in K-12 schools. Efforts to create computer science standards and frameworks have yet to make their way into mandated course requirements. Despite a plethora of research on digital literacies, research on the role of computational thinking in the literature is sparse. This conceptual paper proposes a three dimensional framework for exploring the relationship between computational thinking and literacy through: 1) situating computational thinking in the literature as a literacy; 2) outlining mechanisms by which students' existing literacy skills can be leveraged to foster computational thinking; and 3) elaborating ways in which computational thinking skills facilitate literacy development.",

Programming languages present learning barriers and manual drawing input is not a first class primitive in common programming models. We hypothesize that by developing programming languages and environments that align with how manual artists work, we can build procedural systems that enhance, rather than displace, manual art. To explore this, we developed Dynamic Brushes, a programming and drawing environment motivated by interviews with artists. Dynamic Brushes enables the creation of ad-hoc drawing tools that transform stylus inputs to procedural patterns. Applications range from transforming individual strokes to behaviors that draw multiple strokes simultaneously, respond to temporal events, and leverage external data. Results from an extended evaluation with artists provide guidelines for learnable, expressive systems that blend manual and procedural creation.",

This paper presents a novel methodology for combining CTD with rate-based contact network data to improve posterior precision, and therefore predictive accuracy. We present an advancement in Bayesian inference for epidemics that assimilates these data and is robust to partial contact tracing. Using a simulation study based on the British poultry industry, we show how the presence of CTD improves posterior predictive accuracy and can directly inform a more effective control strategy.",

    abstract = "This study conducted a systematic and thematic review on existing literature in robotics education using robotics kits (not social robots) for young children (Pre-K and kindergarten through 5th grade). This study investigated: (1) the definition of robotics education; (2) thematic patterns of key findings; and (3) theoretical and methodological traits. The results of the review present a limitation of previous research in that it has focused on robotics education only as an instrumental means to support other subjects or STEM education. This study identifies that the findings of the existing research are weighted toward outcome-focused research. Lastly, this study addresses the fact that most of the existing studies used constructivist and constructionist frameworks not only to design and implement robotics curricula but also to analyze young children's engagement in robotics education. Relying on the findings of the review, this study suggests clarifying and specifying robotics-intensified knowledge, skills, and attitudes in defining robotics education in connection to computer science education. In addition, this study concludes that research agendas need to be diversified and the diversity of research participants needs to be broadened. To do this, this study suggests employing social and cultural theoretical frameworks and critical analytical lenses by considering children's historical, cultural, social, and institutional contexts in understanding young children's engagement in robotics education.",

We discuss in detail three dimensions of this social turn\textemdash (1) from writing code to creating applications, (2) from composing from scratch to remixing the work of others, and (3) from designing tools to facilitating communities. These three shifts illustrate how the development of artifacts, tools, and communities of programming lead us to move from computational thinking to computational participation. We draw from examples of past and current research, both inside and outside of school, and situate these developments in the context of current discussions around computational thinking, which has become a driving force in revitalizing programming in K-12 curricula and altogether broadening participation in computing.",

We report on the implementation of an electronic textiles curricular unit in the Exploring Computer Science introductory computing course in 13 high schools involving 272 high school students largely from underrepresented groups in a major metropolitan school district. We examined two issues relevant to broadening equitable participation in CS: (1) students' changed perceptions of computing, and (2) students' depth of learning of computing, circuitry and crafting in the final project. Pre/post surveys on students' perceptions of computing showed positive, significant gains in students' self-confidence in solving CS problems, fascination with computing and ability to be creative with computing. Teacher evaluations of students' final projects revealed robust learning in the areas of basic programming and computational circuitry as well as strong learning across more challenging computational concepts, with room for growth. We discuss factors that impacted student outcomes and outline steps for further analysis.",

Many researchers have tried to define CT and have conducted studies about this topic. However, CT literature is at an early stage of maturity, and is far from either explaining what CT is, or how to teach and assess this skill. In the light of this state of affairs, the purpose of this study is to examine the purpose, target population, theoretical basis, definition, scope, type and employed research design of selected papers in the literature that have focused on computational thinking, and to provide a framework about the notion, scope and elements of CT. In order to reveal the literature and create the framework for computational thinking, an inductive qualitative content analysis was conducted on 125 papers about CT, selected according to pre-defined criteria from six different databases and digital libraries. According to the results, the main topics covered in the papers composed of activities (computerised or unplugged) that promote CT in the curriculum. The targeted population of the papers was mainly K-12. Gamed-based learning and constructivism were the main theories covered as the basis for CT papers. Most of the papers were written for academic conferences and mainly composed of personal views about CT. The study also identified the most commonly used words in the definitions and scope of CT, which in turn formed the framework of CT. The findings obtained in this study may not only be useful in the exploration of research topics in CT and the identification of CT in the literature, but also support those who need guidance for developing tasks or programs about computational thinking and informatics.",

In this paper, which is guided by a systematic literature review, we investigate the issue of inequalities in participation by bringing a theoretical lens from the sociology of education, and particularly, Bourdieu's theory of social reproduction. By paying particular attention to Bourdieu's theorising of capital, habitus, and field, we first establish an alignment between Bourdieu's theory and what is known about inequalities in computer science (CS) participation; we demonstrate how the factors affecting participation constitute capital forms that individuals possess to leverage within the computer science field, while students' views and dispositions towards computer science and scientists are rooted in their habitus which influences their successful assimilation in computer science fields. Subsequently, by projecting the issue of inequalities in CS participation to Bourdieu's sociological theorisations, we explain that because most interventions do not consider the issue holistically and not in formal education settings, the reported benefits do not continue in the long-term which reproduces the problem. Most interventions have indeed contributed significantly to the issue, but they have either focused on developing some aspects of computer science capital or on designing activities that, although inclusive in terms of their content and context, attempt to re-construct students' habitus to ``fit'' in the already ``pathologized'' computer science fields. Therefore, we argue that to contribute significantly to the equity and participation issue in computer science, research and interventions should focus on restructuring the computer science field and the rules of participation, as well as on building holistically students' computer science capital and habitus within computer science fields.",

If the training data is biased towards certain groups or classes of objects, e.g., there is racial discrimination towards black people, the learned model will also show discriminatory behavior towards that particular community. This partial attitude of the learned model may lead to biased outcomes when labeling future unlabeled data objects. Often, however, impartial classification results are desired or even required by law for future data objects in spite of having biased training data. In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing a new classification scheme for learning unbiased models on biased training data. Our method is based on massaging the dataset by making the least intrusive modifications which lead to an unbiased dataset. On this modified dataset we then learn a non-discriminating classifier. The proposed method has been implemented and experimental results on a credit approval dataset show promising results: in all experiments our method is able to reduce the prejudicial behavior for future classification significantly without loosing too much predictive accuracy.",

In this paper, we concentrate on the case with only one binary sensitive attribute and a two-class classification problem. We first study the theoretically optimal trade-off between accuracy and non-discrimination for pure classifiers. Then, we look at algorithmic solutions that preprocess the data to remove discrimination before a classifier is learned. We survey and extend our existing data preprocessing techniques, being suppression of the sensitive attribute, massaging the dataset by changing class labels, and reweighing or resampling the data to remove discrimination without relabeling instances. These preprocessing techniques have been implemented in a modified version of Weka and we present the results of experiments on real-life data.",

    abstract = "Recently, the following discrimination aware classification problem was introduced: given a labeled dataset and an attribute \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend, find a classifier with high predictive accuracy that at the same time does not discriminate on the basis of the given attribute \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend. This problem is motivated by the fact that often available historic data is biased due to discrimination, e.g., when \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend{} denotes ethnicity. Using the standard learners on this data may lead to wrongfully biased classifiers, even if the attribute \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend{} is removed from training data. Existing solutions for this problem consist in ``cleaning away'' the discrimination from the dataset before a classifier is learned. In this paper we study an alternative approach in which the non-discrimination constraint is pushed deeply into a decision tree learner by changing its splitting criterion and pruning strategy. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach advances the state-of-the-art in the sense that the learned decision trees have a lower discrimination than models provided by previous methods, with little loss in accuracy.",

    abstract = "Social discrimination against certain sensitive groups within society (e.g., females, blacks, minorities) is prohibited by law in many countries. To prevent discrimination arising from the use of discriminatory data, recent data mining research has focused on methods for making classifiers learned over discriminatory data discrimination-aware. Most of these methods have been tested on standard classification datasets that have been tweaked for discrimination analysis rather than over actual discriminatory data. In this paper, we study discrimination-aware classification when applied to a realworld dataset of Statistics Netherlands, which is a census body in the Netherlands. Specifically, we consider the use of classifiers for predicting whether an individual is a crime suspect, or not, to support law enforcement and security agencies' decision making. Our results show that discrimination does exist in real world datasets and blind use of classifiers learned over such datasets can exacerbate the discrimination problem. We demonstrate that discrimination-aware classification methods can mitigate the discriminatory effects and that they lead to rational and legally acceptable decisions.",

Several researchers have recently begun to attempt the development of analysis techniques that are aware of social fairness or discrimination. They have shown that simply avoiding the use of sensitive features is insufficient for eliminating biases in determinations, due to the indirect influence of sensitive information. From a privacy-preserving viewpoint, this can be interpreted as hiding sensitive information when classification results are observed. In this paper, we first discuss three causes of unfairness in machine learning. We then propose a regularization approach that is applicable to any prediction algorithm with probabilistic discriminative models. We further apply this approach to logistic regression and empirically show its effectiveness and efficiency.",

The goal of fairness-aware classifiers is to classify data while taking into account the potential issues of fairness, discrimination, neutrality, and/or independence. In this paper, after reviewing fairnessaware classification methods, we focus on one such method, Calders and Verwer's two-naive-Bayes method. This method has been shown superior to the other classifiers in terms of fairness, which is formalized as the statistical independence between a class and a sensitive feature. However, the cause of the superiority is unclear, because it utilizes a somewhat heuristic post-processing technique rather than an explicitly formalized model. We clarify the cause by comparing this method with an alternative naive Bayes classifier, which is modified by a modeling technique called hypothetical fair-factorization. This investigation reveals the theoretical background of the two-naive-Bayes method and its connections with other methods. Based on these findings, we develop another naive Bayes method with an actual fairfactorization technique and empirically show that this new method can achieve an equal level of fairness as that of the two-naiveBayes classifier.",

This article presents a coherent theoretical perspective on the integrative nature of identity and its developmental mechanisms. Adopting the contextual social role as a primary unit of analysis, the Dynamic Systems Model of Role Identity (DSMRI) conceptualizes role identity as a Complex Dynamic System (CDS) anchored in action that comprises the actor's ontological and epistemological beliefs, purpose and goals, self-perceptions and self-definitions, and perceived action possibilities in the role. These system components are conceptualized as interdependent, and identity development is viewed as emergent, continuous, nonlinear, contextualized, and given to influences from within and without the system. The role identity itself constitutes an element within a multilevel hierarchy, which at the unit of analysis of the individual reflects a CDS of the multiple roles that constitute the person's psychosocial identity. Identity development involves the formation and restructuring of relations within and among role identities through intra- and interpersonal processes that are mediated by sociocognitive and cultural means, and framed by the context as well as by implicit dispositions. The DSMRI provides a framework to conceptualize and investigate the nature of the identity system, its development, and the relationship between identity development and psychological functioning at different units of-analysis, across different developmental stages and contexts, and using quantitative and qualitative methodologies.",

Female participation remains a concern in most jurisdictions, but female attainment in CS is relatively unstudied. Using the English national pupil database, we analyzed all exam results (n = 5,370,064) for students taking secondary school exams in 2016, focusing on those students taking GCSE CS (n = 60,736), contrasting this against ICT (n = 67,359). Combining gender with ethnicity and the IDACI poverty indicator, we find that females from the poorest areas were more likely to take CS than those from the richest areas and that CS was more popular among ethnic minority females than white females. ICT was far more equitable for females and poorer students than CS. CS females typically got better grades than their male peers. However, when controlling for average attainment in other subjects, males got 0.31 of a grade higher. Female relative underperformance in CS was most acute among large female cohorts and with girls studying in mixed-gender schools. Girls did significantly better than boys in English when controlling for CS scores, supporting theories around female relative strengths lying outside STEM subjects. The move to introduce CS into the English curriculum and the removal of the ICT qualifications look to be having a negative impact on female participation and attainment in computing. Using the theory of self-efficacy, we argue that the shift towards CS might decrease the number of girls choosing further computing qualifications or pursuing computing as a career.

Because the practical demands of space and cost often dominate decisions concerning a new makerspace, less attention is paid to how the choice of materials inadvertently limits who uses the space, how learning happens, or how materials in a space will interact and intra-act over time. Building on theories of constructionism and relational materialism to analyze and theorize learning in makerspaces, we take a case-based approach to illustrate the co-development of 3D printing materials, youth and educational programs at an out-of-school makerspace. In the process, we demonstrate the need to rethink the role of materials in human development and educational design.

The first set consisted of the results from two earlier, independent studies; the second was collected specifically for this article. We investigate the role played by boundary objects and brokers. Through an analysis of the interplay between boundary object and broker, we uncover the dynamics of the innovation process and show that the role played by the broker can be political. We identify two strategies that are used by brokers in the selection of a boundary object. The first is directed towards achieving a balance between the actors involved and the second is directed towards controlling their activities. We conclude by suggesting that other researchers should also consider the interplay between broker and boundary object when examining cross-boundary knowledge sharing.",

The paper is framed to help researchers consider aspects of both their research project and their research proposal. The authors describe features of high-quality and fundable research projects and whether the research is intended to support descriptive, design-oriented, or causal interpretation. They discuss the critical role of grounding proposed research in existing literatures; attending to relevant research from associated fields; and posing research questions that are clear, specific, and feasibly addressable. The goals of the research should cohere with the methodological and analytic design proposed. The authors also discuss the multidisciplinary nature of research that has implications for practice in general and for educational practice more specifically. The authors touch on the characteristics of more and less successful interdisciplinary research teams, especially those that draw from education, cognitive science, methodology, educational psychology, the learning sciences, and relevant STEM disciplinary fields. Examples of STEM education research questions from different genres of research are considered and the authors describe how the questions themselves give rise to specific design choices, methodologies, measures, study samples, and analytical models as well as how they can reflect the disciplinary orientations of the researchers. Implications of these issues for successful educational research grant proposal writing are discussed.",

We propose that the literature examining the triadic relationships between epistemology (the nature of knowledge), pedagogy (the nature of learning and teaching), and assessment provide critical considerations for bounding this middle space. We provide examples to illustrate the ways in which the understandings of particular analytics are informed by this triad. As a detailed worked example of how one might design analytics to scaffold a specific form of higher order learning, we focus on the construct of epistemic beliefs: beliefs about the nature of knowledge. We argue that analytics grounded in a pragmatic, socio-cultural perspective are well placed to explore this construct using discourse-centric technologies. The examples provided throughout this paper, through emphasizing the consideration of intentional design issues in the middle space, underscore the ``interpretative flexibility'' (Hamilton \\\& Feenberg, 2005) of new technologies, including analytics.",

Students who received at least 6-month programming training for computational thinking development were invited to participate in this study. Results of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) suggested that the CT perspectives instrument (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 100) and CI instrument (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 241) reached good fit and therefore were validated in the pilot study. In the main study, survey answers (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 215) including CT perspectives and CI were collected. Results of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) showed positive relationships between CT perspectives and CI formation among primary school students. Mediation results further revealed that ability to question can foster CI formation through ability to express, while ability to connect can directly foster CI formation.

In this study, a scale has been developed for the purpose of determining the levels of computational thinking skills (CTS) of the students. CTS is a five-point likert type scale and consists of 29 items that could be collected under five factors. The study group of this work consists of 726 students educated at the levels of associate degree and undergraduate degree with formal education in Amasya University for the first application. For the second application 580 students who were educated in pedagogical formation education via distance education in Amasya University. The validity and reliability of the scale have been studied by conducting exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, item distinctiveness analyses, internal consistency coefficients and constancy analyses. As a result of the conducted analyses, it has been concluded that the scale is a valid and reliable measurement tool that could measure the computational thinking skills of the students. In addition; the digital age individuals are expected to have the computational thinking skill, and at what degree they have these skills, the revelation of whether the levels they have are sufficient or not are a requirement.

We start with discussing the notion of semantic shifts, and then continue with an overview of the existing methods for tracing such time-related shifts with word embedding models. We propose several axes along which these methods can be compared, and outline the main challenges before this emerging subfield of NLP, as well as prospects and possible applications.",

However, at some point further model increases become harder due to GPU/TPU memory limitations, longer training times, and unexpected model degradation. To address these problems, we present two parameter-reduction techniques to lower memory consumption and increase the training speed of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). Comprehensive empirical evidence shows that our proposed methods lead to models that scale much better compared to the original BERT. We also use a selfsupervised loss that focuses on modeling inter-sentence coherence, and show it consistently helps downstream tasks with multi-sentence inputs. As a result, our best model establishes new state-of-the-art results on the GLUE, RACE, and SQuAD benchmarks while having fewer parameters compared to BERT-large.

However, it is uncertain how exploring physical computing toolkits can promote movement between conceptual knowledge and abstract reflection, and lead to critical thinking about technology. We investigated how children aged 9-11 years explored and reasoned about personal and environmental data sensors, using a playful explorationbased physical toolkit in their classroom. We report on the ways in which critical thinking about sensor accuracy and reliability developed through reflective dialogue and playful interaction, taking into account the support structures embedded in the classroom. Finally, we discuss strategies for designing exploration-based learning for classroom settings, to promote critical thinking about data sensing.",

This empirical study of CCL is based at Youth Radio, a nationally recognized multimedia production company in Oakland, California. Using embedded ethnographic methods, we focus on one collaborative project inside Youth Radio's Interactive department, where young people partnered with adult colleagues to produce a web-based interactive map of gentrification in a West Oakland neighborhood. Findings demonstrate a highly sophisticated knowledge production process where youth are simultaneously contending with content, message, audience, aesthetics, design, functionality, execution, and the long-term ramifications or ``digital afterlife'' of their work. Through learning environments organized around critical computational literacy, young people emerge as critical problem-solvers unified by the technical know-how and the critical consciousness necessary for them to leverage digital tools for social transformation.",

In this paper, we review the small but growing body of work in this area. We conducted a scoping review to identify 54 relevant publications and chart their commonalities.

Methods for retrofitting pre-trained entity representations to the structure of a knowledge graph typically assume that entities are embedded in a connected space and that relations imply similarity. However, useful knowledge graphs often contain diverse entities and relations (with potentially disjoint underlying corpora) which do not accord with these assumptions. To overcome these limitations, we present Functional Retrofitting, a framework that generalizes current retrofitting methods by explicitly modeling pairwise relations. Our framework can directly incorporate a variety of pairwise penalty functions previously developed for knowledge graph completion. We present both linear and neural instantiations of the framework. Functional Retrofitting significantly outperforms existing retrofitting methods on complex knowledge graphs and loses no accuracy on simpler graphs (in which relations do imply similarity). Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the framework by predicting new drug\textendash disease treatment pairs in a large, complex health knowledge graph.",

The wider aim is to provide a comprehensive map of the kinds of transitions and learning that take place in constructing simple emergent behaviors, particularly for young children. Six kindergarten children participated individually in the study along five sessions. Regarding modes of engagement, it was found that the children conducted intensive and extended playful investigations of the robot's behaviors, interacting with it in a variety of ways; it was also found that their constructions were planful and anticipatory, as they could simulate how the behaviors play out even prior to running their programs. Three kinds of transitions were found in the children's comprehension of the system: one involved adaptation to the formal language; the second, coordination of multiple spatial perspectives; and the third involved a shift from viewing rules as one-time events to their view as recurring and continual descriptions of a process. Finally, it was found that the children employed two strategies to reduce the amount of information in the system: ``pruning'' involved ignoring part of the logical structure and focusing on another; ``fusing'' involved coalescing several rules or functions into one. These results are discussed with respect to previous literature on children's programming and with regards to understanding and supporting young children's learning through their construction of adaptive autonomous behaviors.",

These studies illustrate how "exemplary" instruction moves students much further along the chain than does "typical" instruction. Examination of the background characteristics of students in these courses reveals that general ability and out-of-school computer access are more associated with progress along the chain in typical classes than in exemplary classes.},

Moreover, the results of sequential analysis and content analysis of the videotaped learning process indicated that the teacher's guidance helped the student to assemble or play with the Topobo bricks.

Transforming unstructured text into structured units (e.g., semantically meaningful phrases) will substantially reduce semantic ambiguity and enhance the power and efficiency at manipulating such data using database technology. Thus mining quality phrases is a critical research problem in the field of databases. In this paper, we propose a new framework that extracts quality phrases from text corpora integrated with phrasal segmentation. The framework requires only limited training but the quality of phrases so generated is close to human judgment. Moreover, the method is scalable: both computation time and required space grow linearly as corpus size increases. Our experiments on large text corpora demonstrate the quality and efficiency of the new method.",

    abstract = "The pervasiveness of Computer Science (CS) in today's digital society and the extensive use of computational methods in other sciences call for its introduction in the school curriculum. Hence, Computer Science Education is becoming more and more relevant. In CS K-12 education, computational thinking (CT) is one of the abused buzzwords: different stakeholders (media, educators, politicians) give it different meanings, some more oriented to CS, others more linked to its interdisciplinary value. The expression was introduced by two leading researchers, Jeannette Wing (in 2006) and Seymour Papert (much early, in 1980), each of them stressing different aspects of a common theme. This paper will use a historical approach to review, discuss, and put in context these first two educational and epistemological approaches to CT. We will relate them to today's context and evaluate what aspects are still relevant for CS K-12 education. Of the two, particular interest is devoted to ``Papert's CT,'' which is the lesser-known and the lesser-studied. We will conclude that ``Wing's CT'' and ``Papert's CT,'' when correctly understood, are both relevant to today's computer science education. From Wing, we should retain computer science's centrality, CT being the (scientific and cultural) substratum of the technical competencies. Under this interpretation, CT is a lens and a set of categories for understanding the algorithmic fabric of today's world. From Papert, we should retain the constructionist idea that only a social and affective involvement of students into the technical content will make programming an interdisciplinary tool for learning (also) other disciplines. We will also discuss the often quoted (and often unverified) claim that CT automatically ``transfers'' to other broad 21st century skills. Our analysis will be relevant for educators and scholars to recognize and avoid misconceptions and build on the two core roots of CT.",

To attract Black and Latino students to computer science a promising approach is to engage with their culture, making CS relevant to them personally. To this end, we present an approach that teaches middle school students to program using hip hop beats, intentionally leveraging a genre of music that appeals to a wide array of urban youth of color. This approach, called Code Beats, uses extensive scaffolding to support beginning students, authentic-sounding beats to engage students, and a expressive programming environment to support creative freedom. We present the results of our pilot camp, where students clearly showed an increase in computing enjoyment, confidence, belonging, and persistence. By the end of this course, all students were able to create their own, original beat from scratch, suggesting their progression to the Create phase of the Use-Modify-Create framework.",

Even for non-computing majors, computational thinking is applicable and useful in their daily lives. The three dimensions of computational thinking are computational concepts, computational practices and computational perspectives. In recent years, the availability of free and user-friendly programming languages has fuelled the interest of researchers and educators to explore how computational thinking can be introduced in K-12 contexts. Through an analysis of 27 available intervention studies, this paper presents the current trends of empirical research in the development of computational thinking through programming and suggests possible research and instructional implications. From the review, we propose that more K-12 intervention studies centering on computational practices and computational perspectives could be conducted in the regular classroom. To better examine these two dimensions, students could be asked to verbalize their thought process using think aloud protocol while programming and their on-screen programming activity could be captured and analyzed. Predetermined categories based on both past and recent programming studies could be used to guide the analysis of the qualitative data. As for the instructional implication, it is proposed that a constructionism-based problem-solving learning environment, with information processing, scaffolding and reflection activities, could be designed to foster computational practices and computational perspectives.",

Drawing on data from a nationally representative survey of more than 1,700 college students at 22 colleges and universities, the study tested the alignment of the theorized model to the measures on the survey. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was used to validate whether the appropriate measures loaded on the three separate sub-constructs. Criterion-related validity was also established by testing whether the computing identity measures predicted the choice of a computer science career. The results reveal that a computing identity proxy based on the theorized measures was a highly significant predictor of students' computer science and information technology career choice (p {$<$} 0.0001). In addition, this work also established criterion-related validity by showing gender differences that had been found by prior work in computing. Finally, the theorized measures were found to be reliable and internally consistent. The educational understanding of computing identities may provide an important tool to help researchers and practitioners improve student persistence in computer science.",

First, we propose a discrimination discovery method based on modeling the probability distribution of a class using Bayesian networks. This measures the effect of a protected attribute (e.g., gender) in a subset of the dataset using the estimated probability distribution (via a Bayesian network). Second, we propose a classification method that corrects for the discovered discrimination without using protected attributes in the decision process. We evaluate the discrimination discovery and discrimination prevention approaches on two different datasets.

Further, researchers desire automation after having developed a codebook and coded a subset of data, particularly in extending their coding to unseen data. Researchers also require any assistive tool to be transparent about its recommendations. Based on our findings, we built prototypes to partially automate coding using simple natural language processing techniques. Our top-performing system generates coding that matches human coders on inter-rater reliability measures. We discuss implications for interface and algorithm design, meta-issues around automating qualitative research, and suggestions for future work.",

Traditional approaches to mathematical modelling of infectious diseases deal most effectively with large outbreaks in large populations. The desire to elucidate the highly variable dynamics of disease spread amongst small numbers of individuals has fuelled the development of models that depend more directly on surveillance and contact-tracing data.

Ninety-two articles describing informal learning activities were reviewed for 24 program elements (i.e., activity components, and student/instructor demographics). These 24 program elements were defined and shaped by a virtual focus group study and the articles themselves. Results indicate that the majority of authors adequately report age/grade levels of participants, number of participants, the type of activity, when the activity was offered, the tools/languages used in the activity, and whether the activity was required or elective. However, there is a deficiency in reporting many other important and foundational program elements, including contact hours of activity participants, clear learning objectives, the prior experience of participants (students and instructors), and many more. In conjunction with previous work, this paper provides recommendations to reduce these deficiencies. The Recommendations for Reporting Pre-College Computing Activities (Version 1.0) are presented to help researchers improve the quality of papers, set a standard of necessary data needed to replicate studies, and provide a basis for comparing activities and activity outcomes across multiple studies and experiences.",

We found that the majority of constructs were designed to measure Student Engagement (Affect and Cognition) and School Climate (Teacher Variables). Constructs measuring Learning Strategies and Social-Familial Influences (e.g., homework strategies, peer influences) occur the least.

While some studies have shown how various beliefs affect students' abilities to solve problems, studies are needed that explicitly examine the beliefs and assumptions students bring to the problem-solving process. Purpose/Hypothesis The purpose of this qualitative research was to describe students' engineering problem-solving processes and develop a conceptual model that illustrates students' beliefs about problem solving. Our research question was, What beliefs do students have about engineering problem solving? Design/Method We analyzed data from retrospective semistructured interviews carried out after a problem-solving session. We interviewed nine engineering students about the processes they used to solve the problems and the assumptions and beliefs that guided their problem solving. We then used grounded theory to identify and analyze statements from the interviews and to develop a conceptual model of student beliefs. Results The resulting model has five major categories: the problem-solving process itself, the role of classroom problems, the role of workplace problems, personal characteristics that affect problem solving, and resources that assist problem solving. Students identify a sharp distinction between classroom problems and workplace problems. Conclusions Our conceptual model provides an initial framework for understanding how students' beliefs affect their approaches to engineering problems. In contrast to stage models, our model shows that students' epistemic beliefs about problem solving are contextual. Future work is needed to understand the limits and extend the applicability of our model.",

However, defining process characteristics relevant for collaboration quality and developing instruments capable of assessing these characteristics are no trivial tasks. In the assessment method presented in this paper, nine qualitatively defined dimensions of collaboration are rated quantitatively: sustaining mutual understanding, dialogue management, information pooling, reaching consensus, task division, time management, technical coordination, reciprocal interaction, and individual task orientation. The data basis for the development of these dimensions was taken from a study in which students of psychology and medicine collaborated on a complex patient case via a desktop-videoconferencing system. A qualitative content analysis was performed on a sample of transcribed collaboration dialogue. The insights from this analysis were then integrated with theoretical considerations about the roles of communication, joint information processing, coordination, interpersonal relationship, and motivation in the collaboration process. The resulting rating scheme was applied to process data from a new sample of 40 collaborating dyads. Based on positive findings on inter-rater reliability, consistency, and validity from this evaluation, we argue that the new method can be recommended for use in different areas of CSCL.",

We report findings from four design workshops with 31 pro-choice stakeholders across Ireland in which we positioned an exploratory protosite, HerStoryTold, to engender critical conversations around the use of sensitive abortion narratives as a tool for engagement. Our analysis shows how digital storytelling can help reject false narratives and raise awareness of the realities of abortion laws. It suggests design directions to curate narratives that provoke empathy, foster polyvocality, and ultimately expand the engaged community.

Board of Education decision, sheds light on why Black students succeeded in all-Black schools as well as challenges faced in advancing racial justice. In his context, according to Mr. Williams, Black students succeeded because of the influence of Black teachers and the discipline that was cultivated among teachers and students. However, discipline was conceptualized and practiced in a developmentally supportive manner for students during segregation while it is practiced as a form of exclusion in schools currently. Milner argues that we should change our language of disciplinary practices to punishment practices to more accurately capture current practices. In addition, Milner introduces curriculum punishment as a tool to describe how students are punished when they are not exposed to potentially transformative, racially just learning opportunities that can result in vicarious trauma.

Stealth assessment analyzes a stream of fine-grained student interaction data from a game-based learning environment to dynamically draw inferences about students' competencies through evidence-centered design. In evidence-centered design, evidence models have been traditionally designed using statistical rules authored by domain experts that are encoded using Bayesian networks. This article presents DEEPSTEALTH, a deep learning-based stealth assessment framework, that yields significant reductions in the feature engineering labor that has previously been required to create stealth assessments. DEEPSTEALTH utilizes end-to-end trainable deep neural network-based evidence models. Using this framework, evidence models are devised using a set of predictive features captured from raw, low-level interaction data to infer evidence for competencies. We investigate two deep learning-based evidence models, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and n-gram encoded feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). We compare these models' predictive performance for inferring students' knowledge to linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) and na\texteuro\i ve Bayes models. We perform feature set-level analyses of game trace logs and external pre-learning measures, and we examine the models' early prediction capacity. The framework is evaluated using data collected from 182 middle school students interacting with a game-based learning environment for middle grade computational thinking. Results indicate that LSTMbased stealth assessors outperform competitive baseline approaches with respect to predictive accuracy and early prediction capacity. We find that LSTMs, FFNNs, and CRFs all benefit from combined feature sets derived from both game trace logs and external prelearning measures.",

A central component of the behavior construction environment is the RoboGan software that supports children's construction of spatiotemporal events with an a-temporal rule structure. Six kindergarten children participated in the study, three girls and three boys. Activities and interviews were conducted individually along five sessions that included increasingly complex construction tasks. It was found that all of the children succeeded in constructing most such behaviors, debugging their constructions in a relatively small number of cycles. An adult's assistance in noticing relevant features of the problem was necessary for the more complex tasks that involved four complementary rules. The spatial scaffolding afforded by the RoboGan interface was well used by the children, as they consistently used partial backtracking strategies to improve their constructions, and employed modular construction strategies in the more complex tasks. The children's explanations following their construction usually capped at one rule, or two condition-action couples, one rule short of their final constructions. With respect to tasks that involved describing a demonstrated robot's behavior, in describing their constructions, explanations tended to be more rule-based, complex and mechanistic. These results are discussed with respect to the importance of making such physical/computational environments available to young children, and support of young children's learning about such intelligent systems and reasoning in developmentally-advanced forms.",

The second is addressing issues that arise when one attempts to design assessments that are at once compatible with SC principles and suitable for large-scale use.

To address this question, the authors review various ways of conceptualizing identity by using five metaphors for identity documented in the identity literature: identity as (1) difference, (2) sense of self/subjectivity, (3) mind or consciousness, (4) narrative, and (5) position. Few literacy studies have acknowledged this range of perspectives on and views for conceptualizing identity and yet, subtle differences in identity theories have widely different implications for how one thinks about both how literacy matters to identity and how identity matters to literacy. The authors offer this review to encourage more theorizing of both literacy and identity as social practices and, most important, of how the two breathe life into each other.",

While both 6th grade experimental groups working with coding activities showed a statistically significant improvement in terms of academic performance, this was not the case in the 2nd grade classroom.

The activities combined generic and domain-specific skills practices in different ways. We analyze how these two modes intertwine and argue that the teaching model we used can bridge the gap between learning in and out school. Key concepts used in the analysis are intersubjectivity, tension, and temporality. Our findings indicate that through Minecraft pupils, teachers, and amateur historians contribute to intersubjectivity toward shared knowledge by setting and releasing tensions between generic and domain specific knowledge.",

What does it mean to make an identity available in the context of a learning setting? In this article, we draw on current theories in anthropology, psychology, sociology, and sociocultural theory to develop a conceptual frame that might be helpful in addressing these questions. We focus on how individuals are offered (and how they take up) identities in cultural activities. We define three types of identity resources that were made available to student-athletes learning to run track and explore how they took shape in teaching and learning interactions in track.

Two bodies of literature are discussed and synthesized: (1) sociocultural theory and (2) studies on race, culture, and learning. The article proposes how a sociocultural lens might provide insight and suggests new lines of research on issues of race, culture, and learning. The authors argue for the extension of each of four lines of research in the sociocultural tradition: a concern with multiple levels of analysis, cultural practices as a unit of analysis, tools and artifacts as mediating action, and learning as shifts in social relations. In doing so, the authors raise critical questions for the field of education to consider.",

Needed is learning theory that can guide us in creating schools and classrooms where deep learning occurs, where learners' full selves are engaged, and that disrupt existing patterns of inequality and oppression. In this article, we build on recent research in education, neuroscience, psychology, and anthropology to articulate a theory of learning that has the potential to move us toward that goal. We elaborate four key principles of learning: (1) learning is rooted in evolutionary, biological, and neurological systems; (2) learning is integrated with other developmental processes whereby the whole child (emotion, identity, cognition) must be taken into account; (3) learning is shaped in culturally organized practice across people's lives; and (4) learning is experienced as embodied and coordinated through social interaction. Taken together, these principles help us understand learning in a way that foregrounds the range of community and cultural experiences people have throughout the life course and across the multiple settings of life and accounts for learning as set within systems of injustice.",

In this pursuit, we have increasingly drawn upon theories from learning science and education research, recognizing the potential benefits of optimizing our search for better designs by leveraging the predictions of general theories of learning. In this paper, we contribute an argument that theory can also inhibit our community's search for better designs. We present three inhibitions: 1) our desire to both advance explanatory theory and advance design splits our attention, which prevents us from excelling at both; 2) our emphasis on applying and refining general theories of learning is done at the expense of domain-specific theories of computer science knowledge, and 3) our use of theory as a critical lens in peer review prevents the publication of designs that may accelerate design progress. We present several recommendations for how to improve our use of theory, viewing it as just one of many sources of design insight in pursuit of improving learning of computing.",

The first, pattern detection step, involves inductive computational exploration of text, using techniques such as unsupervised machine learning and word scores to help researchers to see novel patterns in their data. The second, pattern refinement step, returns to an interpretive engagement with the data through qualitative deep reading or further exploration of the data. The third, pattern confirmation step, assesses the inductively identified patterns using further computational and natural language processing techniques. The result is an efficient, rigorous, and fully reproducible computational grounded theory. This framework can be applied to any qualitative text as data, including transcribed speeches, interviews, open-ended survey data, or ethnographic field notes, and can address many potential research questions.",

Critical race theory uses storytelling as a means to upend deepseated assumptions, and we relate several personal stories to highlight ongoing problems of race in HCI. The implications: all HCI research must be attuned to issues of race; participation of underrepresented minorities must be sought in all of our activities; and as a community, we cannot become comfortable while racial disparities exist.",

In this paper, we investigate how both the use of multimodal data and moving from averages and counts to temporal aspects in a collaborative setting provides a better prediction of learning gains. To address these questions, we analyze multimodal data collected from 25 9\textendash 11-year-old dyads using a fractions intelligent tutoring system. Assessing the relation of dual gaze, tutor log, audio and dialog data to students' learning gains, we find that a combination of modalities, especially those at a smaller time scale, such as gaze and audio, provides a more accurate prediction of learning gains than models with a single modality.

The essay responds to the turn toward data-driven teaching and learning in education and argues that digital data is not only generated through national, state, and classroom-level assessments but also produced through the platform technologies that increasingly support all kinds of school operations. While much has been written about the promise of such technologies for schools, less is known about the role digital platforms play in constituting this data and how the platforms can be critically engaged to build knowledge and understanding of datafication processes in classrooms. This article explores these dynamics through three vignettes that investigate platforms as an interface for teaching and learning about data. In doing so, the essay speaks back to three interrelated properties of datafication\textemdash reduction, abstraction, and individualization\textemdash{} in ways that can be made visible for analysis, critique, and resistance in schools.",

To support the kinds of computer science curriculum and instruction that makes this possible, there is an urgent need to develop and validate computational thinking (CT) assessments for elementary-aged students. We developed the Assessment of Computing for Elementary Students (ACES) to measure the CT concepts of loops and sequences for students in grades 3-5. The ACES includes block-based coding questions as well as non-programming, Bebras-style questions. We conducted cognitive interviews to understand student perspectives while taking the ACES. We piloted the assessment with 57 4th grade students who had completed a CT curriculum. Preliminary analyses indicate acceptable reliability and appropriate difficulty and discrimination among assessment items. The significance of this paper is to present a new CT measure for upper elementary students and to share its intentional development process.",

Moreover, little is known about their historical roots, current status, and future prospects. The literature has largely ignored the various culture center models, and the role that such centers play in the experiences of college students. This book fills a significant void in the research on ethnic minority cultural centers, offers the historic background to their establishment and development, considers the circumstances that led to their creation, examines the roles they play on campus, explores their impact on retention and campus climate, and provides guidelines for their management in the light of current issues and future directions.In the first part of this volume, the contributors provide perspectives on culture centers from the point of view of various racial/ethnic identity groups, Latina/o, Asian, American Indian, and African American. Part II offers theoretical perspectives that frame the role of culture centers from the point of view of critical race theory, student development theory, and a social justice framework. Part III focuses specifically on administrative and practice-oriented themes, addressing such issues as the relative merits of full- and part-time staff, of race/ethnic specific as opposed to multicultural centers, relations with the outside community, and integration with academic and student affairs to support the mission of the institution. For administrators and student affairs educators who are unfamiliar with these facilities, and want to support an increasingly diverse student body, this book situates such centers within the overall strategy of improving campus climate, and makes the case for sustaining them. Where none as yet exist, this book offers a rationale and blueprint for creating such centers. For leaders of culture centers this book constitutes a valuable tool for assessing their viability, improving their performance, and ensuring their future relevance \textendash{} all considerations of increased importance when budgets and resources are strained. This book also provides a foundation for researchers interested in further investigating the role of these centers in higher education.",

We tackle the problem of determining, given a dataset of historical decision records, a precise measure of the degree of discrimination suffered by a given group (e.g., an etnic minority) in a given context (e.g., a geographic area) with respect to the decision (e.g. credit denial). In our approach, this problem is rephrased in a classification rule based setting, and a collection of quantitative measures of discrimination is introduced, on the basis of existing norms and regulations. The measures are defined as functions of the contingency table of a classification rule, and their statistical significance is assessed, relying on a large body of statistical inference methods for proportions. Based on this basic method, we are then able to address the more general problems of: (1) unveiling all discriminatory decision patterns hidden in the historical data, combining discrimination analysis with association rule mining, (2) unveiling discrimination in classifiers that learn over training data biased by discriminatory decisions, and (3) in the case of rule-based classifiers, sanitizing discriminatory rules by correcting their confidence. Our approach is validated on the German credit dataset and on the CPAR classifier.",

The second is political and economic: There are many ways in which the current spread of English, teachtag methods, and textbooks can be seen as a recapitulation, if not an intensification, of (neo-)coloni\textsterling d relations. And the third is cultural, by which I mean that the conjuncture between ELT and colonialism has had long-lasting effects on the theories, practices, and beliefs of ELT: From classroom practices to beliefs about the cultural makeup of our students, many aspects of ELT reproduce cultural constructs of colonialism. This chapter will give an overview of these concerns and will also discuss how postcolonial perspectives on ELT may provide a way out of these cycles.",

In this study, we explore ways that school districts engage youth to contribute to the shaping and enactment of their CS instructional systems, efforts districts make to have these leadership roles create impact within these systems, and the tensions associated with these processes. Through in depth analysis of five district case studies, our findings highlight variance around the nature of leadership roles , how access to leadership roles is structured, student autonomy within and ownership over leadership roles, how roles reach into and index differential power over instructional systems , and how district processes of scaffolding and infrastructuring mediate the ultimate impact that students in these roles are able to have on CS instructional systems. Findings also surfaced ways that district actors dealt with a number of tensions associated with student leadership within CS instructional systems. This study provides educators, administrators, and researchers with an expansive view of the potential for students to play legitimate roles within the context of system-wide instructional efforts around CS, and aims to expand conceptions of `equitable computer science'\textemdash up to this point largely conceived of through the lenses of access to, participation in, and experiences of CS learning\textemdash to focus on equity as also being about who has `a seat at the table' when it comes to CS.",

The growth in these analytic activities leads to the need to find ways to synthesize understandings, find common language, and develop frames of reference to help these movements develop into a field.",

Despite the subtlety of difference between their tasks, participants foraged remarkably differently\textemdash making foraging decisions from different types of ``patches,'' with different types of information, and succeeding with different foraging tactics.",

Methods: We developed a continuous-time stochastic simulation of smallpox transmission, including network structure, post-exposure vaccination, vaccination of contacts of contacts, limited response capacity, heterogeneity in symptoms and infectiousness, vaccination prior to the discontinuation of routine vaccination, more rapid diagnosis due to public awareness, surveillance of asymptomatic contacts, and isolation of cases. Results: We found that even in cases of very rapidly spreading smallpox, ring vaccination (when coupled with surveillance) is sufficient in most cases to eliminate smallpox quickly, assuming that 95\\\% of household contacts are traced, 80\\\% of workplace or social contacts are traced, and no casual contacts are traced, and that in most cases the ability to trace 1\textendash 5 individuals per day per index case is sufficient. If smallpox is assumed to be transmitted very quickly to contacts, it may at times escape containment by ring vaccination, but could be controlled in these circumstances by mass vaccination. Conclusions: Small introductions of smallpox are likely to be easily contained by ring vaccination, provided contact tracing is feasible. Uncertainties in the nature of bioterrorist smallpox (infectiousness, vaccine efficacy) support continued planning for ring vaccination as well as mass vaccination. If initiated, ring vaccination should be conducted without delays in vaccination, should include contacts of contacts (whenever there is sufficient capacity) and should be accompanied by increased public awareness and surveillance.",

Drawing inspiration from Margolis and Fisher's work drawing the ``blueprints'' of the ``boy's clubhouse'' of computing education [20], as well as McDermott and Webber's analysis of when math learning occurs [22], we ask when, where, and how is gender being invoked and created, as a way to unpack the places, events, and interactions that shape women's participation in the Silicon Valley workforce. This qualitative analysis of 13 life history interviews with professional women in computing shows that gender becomes salient for women in public settings, particularly in early adulthood when women enter male-dominated classrooms, teams, and workplaces that foster ``brogramming'' culture. CS educators, hiring managers, and recruiters all need to be aware that the effects of gender go beyond just including more women in classrooms and on teams. The learning environment, incentives for participation, and the goal of diversity all need to be better aligned in order to foster an equitable workforce.",

We find that a topic's rhetorical function is highly predictive of its eventual growth or decline.

The original taxonomy organized tools according to the barriers to learning programming they addressed, and the strategies used to surmount or avoid the barriers. Updating the taxonomy was not entirely successful; some strategies have emerged as widely-used best practices. As computers and programming have become more prevalent in everyday life, it has become harder to distinguish programming from non-programming, and harder to distinguish tools for learning from ordinary computational tools. Programming, formerly a specialized activity, has developed into a computational literacy comprising many different forms of cultural interaction. We propose a new taxonomy based on DiSessa's analysis of the structure of literacy. The new taxonomy allows learners, teachers, and designers to ground decisions about how to learn or teach programming in literacy aims expressing why they want to learn to program."

Both metrics were associated with performance on the summative task, but engagement had a much more substantial effect.

However, even in research showing the importance of sociocultural factors, quantitative assessment of Computer Science learning has been predominantly cognitive. This study presents an example of how quantitative assessments of learning, based on cognitive and sociocultural framings of learning, can be put into dialogue by developing measures of learning on internal individual terms and understood as participation in a community of practice. We develop two participationbased constructs assessed using methods from learning analytics, and show that each is significantly associated with better performance on a cognitively-based summative assessment of computer science content. These associations are mediated by the content of students' programs. Beyond serving as contextual factors for cognitive assessments, we propose treating these constructs as primary evidence of learning.",

This paper examines the role that user interfaces have on children's mastery of computational thinking concepts and positive interpersonal behaviors. Background: There is a growing pressure to begin teaching computational thinking at a young age. This study explores the affordances of two very different programming interfaces for teaching computational thinking: a graphical coding application on the iPad (ScratchJr) and tangible programmable robotics kit (KIBO). Methodology : This study used a mixed-method approach to explore the learning experiences that young children have with tangible and graphical coding interfaces. A sample of children ages four to seven (N = 28) participated. Findings: Results suggest that type of user interface does have an impact on children's learning, but is only one of many factors that affect positive academic and socio-emotional experiences. Tangible and graphical interfaces each have qualities that foster different types of learning",

The self-report instrument, Computer Science Attitudes Scale for middle school students (MG-CS Attitudes), was developed based upon expectancy-value theory, which assumes two attitudinal constructs: self-efficacy and outcome expectancy. A set of ten initial items was administered to 663 middle-grade students from sixth to eighth grade (11\textendash 13 years of age). A combination of classical test theory and item response theory approaches were used to evaluate and validate the instrument using wellestablished construct validity frameworks to guide the process, leading to nine final items. The multi-stage validation process has resulted in a robust, well-functioning instrument, which can be used by researchers and evaluators to study CS-related educational interventions.",

Effective text mining in this setting requires models that can flexibly account for the textual patterns that underlie the observed labels while still discovering unlabeled topics. Neither supervised classification, with its focus on label prediction, nor purely unsupervised learning, which does not model the labels explicitly, is appropriate. In this paper, we present two new partially supervised generative models of labeled text, Partially Labeled Dirichlet Allocation (PLDA) and the Partially Labeled Dirichlet Process (PLDP). These models make use of the unsupervised learning machinery of topic models to discover the hidden topics within each label, as well as unlabeled, corpus-wide latent topics. We explore applications with qualitative case studies of tagged web pages from del.icio.us and PhD dissertation abstracts, demonstrating improved model interpretability over traditional topic models. We use the many tags present in our del.icio.us dataset to quantitatively demonstrate the new models' higher correlation with human relatedness scores over several strong baselines.",

Without honest conversations about power relations within the field of Computing, one cannot expect to engender social change that equates to equity for all CS students. Leveraging intersectionality as a critical framework, we interview 18 Black women about their experiences navigating the computing education ecosystem. Intersectional analysis of Black women's experiences reveals that CS education consists of saturated sites of violence in which interconnected systems of power converge to enact oppression. Findings reveal three saturated sites of violence within CS education: 1. traditional K-12 classrooms; 2. predominantly White institutions; and 3. internships as supplementary learning experiences.",

TechCheck is based on developmentally appropriate CT concepts and uses a multiple-choice ``unplugged'' format that allows it to be administered to whole classes or online settings in under 15 min. This design allows assessment of a broad range of abilities and avoids conflating coding with CT skills. We validated the instrument in a cohort of 5\textendash 9-year-old students (N = 768) participating in a research study involving a robotics coding curriculum. TechCheck showed good reliability and validity according to measures of classical test theory and item response theory. Discrimination between skill levels was adequate. Difficulty was suitable for first graders and low for second graders. The instrument showed differences in performance related to race/ethnicity. TechCheck scores correlated moderately with a previously validated CT assessment tool (TACTIC-KIBO). Overall, TechCheck has good psychometric properties, is easy to administer and score, and discriminates between children of different CT abilities. Implications, limitations, and directions for future work are discussed.",

Unfortunately, this focus is now holding back research from systematically investigating various technological affordances that can make programming more accessible. Employing approaches from program analysis, program visualization, and real-time interfaces can push blocks programming beyond syntax towards the support of semantics and even pragmatics. Syntactic support could be compared to checking spelling and grammar in word processing. Spell checking is relatively simple to implement and immediately useful, but provides essentially no support to create meaningful text. Over the last 25 years, I have worked to empower students to create their own games, simulations, and robots. In this time I have explored, combined, and evaluated a number of programming paradigms. Every paradigm including data flow, programming by example, and programming through analogies brings its own set of affordances and obstacles. Twenty years ago, AgentSheets combined four key affordances of blocks programming, and since then has evolved into a highly accessible Computational Thinking Tool. This article describes the journey to overcome first syntactic, then semantic, and most recently pragmatic, obstacles in computer science education.",

Later, other participants listened to these monologues while viewing the same screen. Eye movements were recorded for all speakers and listeners. According to cross-recurrence analysis, a listener's eye movements most closely matched a speaker's eye movements at a delay of 2 sec. Indeed, the more closely a listener's eye movements were coupled with a speaker's, the better the listener did on a comprehension test. In a second experiment, low-level visual cues were used to manipulate the listeners' eye movements, and these, in turn, influenced their latencies to comprehension questions.

Social scientists often want to move beyond exploration, to measurement and experimentation, and make inference about social and political processes that drive discourse and content. In this article, we develop a model of text data that supports this type of substantive research. Our approach is to posit a hierarchical mixed membership model for analyzing topical content of documents, in which mixing weights are parameterized by observed covariates. In this model, topical prevalence and topical content are specified as a simple generalized linear model on an arbitrary number of documentlevel covariates, such as news source and time of release, enabling researchers to introduce elements of the experimental design that informed document collection into the model, within a generally applicable framework. We demonstrate the proposed methodology by analyzing a collection of news reports about China, where we allow the prevalence of topics to evolve over time and vary across newswire services. Our methods quantify the effect of news wire source on both the frequency and nature of topic coverage. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.",

End-to-end differentiable neural architectures have failed to approach state-of-the-art performance until very recently. In this paper, we propose a neural model that reads two sentences to determine entailment using long short-term memory units. We extend this model with a word-by-word neural attention mechanism that encourages reasoning over entailments of pairs of words and phrases. Furthermore, we present a qualitative analysis of attention weights produced by this model, demonstrating such reasoning capabilities. On a large entailment dataset this model outperforms the previous best neural model and a classifier with engineered features by a substantial margin. It is the first generic end-to-end differentiable system that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a textual entailment dataset.",

I will describe the most popular tools (see Stuckey, Taylor, Cranton, 2013) for the evaluation of the outcomes of learning activities that may be conceptualized as transformative experiences. The four instruments compared are: 1. Kember's Critical Reflection Questionnaire, a 16-question, four-scale questionnaire (Kember et al., 2000, p. 392); 2. Learning Activity Survey (Learning Activities Survey, King, 2009) questionnaire, based on the theory of the ten steps precursors to transformative learning (King, 2009); 3. Transformative Learning Survey (Stuckey, Taylor, Cranton, 2014); 4. VALUE rubric (Valid Assessment of Learning in Undergraduate Education) (AACU, 2013), whose variation Student Transformative Learning Record (Barthell et al., 2010) was created for the assessment of students' own authentic work. Those instruments represent the effort of (a) going beyond the qualitative retrospective approach and (b) finding indicators for the critical reflection engaged by people (students or professionals) in their learning experiences. The purpose is to appeal to faculty members, adult educators, professional coaches, mentoring experts, healthcare professionals in Counselling and Psychotherapy, offering them a review of both qualitative and quantative approaches that they could adopt in their professional practices.",

The objective of this survey is to provide a guidance and a glue for researchers and anti-discrimination data analysts on concepts, problems, application areas, datasets, methods, and approaches from a multidisciplinary perspective. We organize the approaches according to their method of data collection as observational, quasiexperimental, and experimental studies.

While some data mining techniques have been adapted to the purpose, the state-of-the-art of research still needs both methodological refinements, the consolidation of a Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, and, most of all, experimentation with real data. This paper contributes by presenting a case study on gender discrimination in a dataset of scientific research proposals, and by distilling from the case study a general discrimination discovery process. Gender bias in scientific research is a challenging problem, that has been tackled in the social sciences literature by means of statistical regression. However, this approach is limited to test an hypothesis of discrimination over the whole dataset under analysis. Our methodology couples data mining, for unveiling previously unknown contexts of possible discrimination, with statistical regression, for testing the significance of such contexts, thus obtaining the best of the two worlds.",

However, there is still no consensus on a CT definition or how to measure it. In response, we attempt to address both issues from a psychometric approach. On the one hand, a Computational Thinking Test (CTt) is administered on a sample of 1,251 Spanish students from 5th to 10th grade, so its descriptive statistics and reliability are reported in this paper. On the second hand, the criterion validity of the CTt is studied with respect to other standardized psychological tests: the Primary Mental Abilities (PMA) battery, and the RP30 problem-solving test. Thus, it is intended to provide a new instrument for CT measurement and additionally give evidence of the nature of CT through its associations with key related psychological constructs. Results show statistically significant correlations at least moderately intense between CT and: spatial ability (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.44), reasoning ability (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.44), and problemsolving ability (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.67). These results are consistent with recent theoretical proposals linking CT to some components of the Cattel-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model of intelligence, and corroborate the conceptualization of CT as a problem-solving ability.",

In our analyses, we reflect on how the changes in context of collaboration (context), the opportunities for finding collaborators (connection), and the engagement of members in constructive feedback (critique) emerged as critical spaces supportive of online collaboration. We discuss how these spaces can serve as guiding principles for online communities that support young designers in creating expressive and personally meaningful projects together.",

In this work, we propose a framework together with a novel type of data analysis that seeks to study the spread of such practices by tracking their syntactic signatures in large document collections. Central to this framework is the notion of an "inheritance graph" that represents how people pass the practice on to others through collaboration. Our analysis of these inheritance graphs demonstrates that we can trace a significant number of practices over long time-spans, and we show that the structure of these graphs can help in predicting the longevity of collaborations within a field, as well as the fitness of the practices themselves.},

We formalize the process of direct and indirect discrimination discovery in a rule-based framework, by modelling protected-by-law groups, such as minorities or disadvantaged segments, and contexts where discrimination occurs. Classification rules, extracted from the historical records, allow for unveiling contexts of unlawful discrimination, where the degree of burden over protected-by-law groups is evaluated by formalizing existing norms and regulations in terms of quantitative measures. The measures are defined as functions of the contingency table of a classification rule, and their statistical significance is assessed, relying on a large body of statistical inference methods for proportions. Key legal concepts and reasonings are then used to drive the analysis on the set of classification rules, with the aim of discovering patterns of discrimination, either direct or indirect. Analyses of affirmative action, favoritism and argumentation against discrimination allegations are also modelled in the proposed framework. Finally, we present an implementation, called LP2DD, of the overall reference model that integrates induction, through data mining classification rule extraction, and deduction, through a computational logic implementation of the analytical tools. The LP2DD system is put at work on the analysis of a dataset of credit decision records.",

Twenty-seven pairs of apprentices in logistics ( N = 54) interacted with an interactive simulation of a warehouse. Their task was to discover efficient design principles for building storehouses. In a between-subjects experimental design, half of the participants used 3D physical shelves, whereas the other half used 2D paper shelves. This manipulation allowed us to control for the ``representational effect'' of 3D tangibles: the first group saw the warehouse as a small-scale model with realistic shelves, whereas the second group had access to a more abstract layout with rectangular pieces of paper. Both groups interacted with the system in the same way. We found that participants in the first group (i.e., who used 3D realistic shelves) better memorized a warehouse layout, built a more efficient model, and scored higher on a learning test. Additionally, students wore eye-tracking goggles while completing those tasks; preliminary results suggest that 3D interfaces increased joint visual attention, which was found to be a significant predictor for participants' task performance and learning gains. Implications for designing TUIs in collaborative settings are discussed.",

An ecological evaluation of BrainExplorer revealed that 1) students who engaged in the open-ended exploration outperformed students who used traditional textbook materials and 2) correctly sequencing activities is fundamental for improving student performance. Participants who used the tabletop first and then studied a text significantly outperformed participants who read a text first and then used the tabletop. Additionally, those results were best predicted by the quality of students' verbalizations while using BrainExplorer.

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and, more recently, Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has demonstrated the lethality of CoVs when they cross the species barrier and infect humans. A renewed interest in coronaviral research has led to the discovery of several novel human CoVs and since then much progress has been made in understanding the CoV life cycle. The CoV envelope (E) protein is a small, integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus' life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis. Recent studies have expanded on its structural motifs and topology, its functions as an ion-channelling viroporin, and its interactions with both other CoV proteins and host cell proteins. Main body: This review aims to establish the current knowledge on CoV E by highlighting the recent progress that has been made and comparing it to previous knowledge. It also compares E to other viral proteins of a similar nature to speculate the relevance of these new findings. Good progress has been made but much still remains unknown and this review has identified some gaps in the current knowledge and made suggestions for consideration in future research. Conclusions: The most progress has been made on SARS-CoV E, highlighting specific structural requirements for its functions in the CoV life cycle as well as mechanisms behind its pathogenesis. Data shows that E is involved in critical aspects of the viral life cycle and that CoVs lacking E make promising vaccine candidates. The high mortality rate of certain CoVs, along with their ease of transmission, underpins the need for more research into CoV molecular biology which can aid in the production of effective anti-coronaviral agents for both human CoVs and enzootic CoVs.",

    abstract = "This article investigates the motivations of African American and Latino girls ( N = 41) who navigate urban Southwest school districts during the day, but voluntarily attend a 2-year, culturally responsive multimedia program after school and into the summer. Understanding that girls from economically disadvantaged settings are indeed motivated to become technological innovators but often do not have access to the necessary resources to follow their interest, our program\textemdash entitled COMPUGIRLS\textemdash assumes a culturally responsive computing approach. This research examines particular features of the program (e.g., asset building, reflections, and connectedness) that attracted and retained the Latina (74\\\%) and African American (19\\\%) adolescent (ages 13-18) participants as well as to what extent the culturally relevant aspects of the curriculum assist with program retention and/or affect the students' vision of themselves as a future technologist. An evaluative approach gathered 2 years of data from the participants. Field notes from observations and interviews were transcribed and reviewed to extract themes and areas of convergence. As a standpoint theory project, the authors center the girls' voices as the primary data sources. Two primary themes emerged from the data to explain girls' sustained motivation. The first was the challenge of learning and mastering the technology. For many, this also included disproving the stereotypes of their abilities by age, gender, and race. The second theme was being able to manipulate technology and learning experiences as a means of self-expression and research, particularly if the results could be used to inform their community and peers. The authors posit that much of the program impact was because of the culturally responsive practices (asset building, reflection, and connectedness) embedded within the curriculum. Implications for urban educators and program developers are considered.",

The term is defined as the concept of thinking about problems in a way that can be implemented in a computing device. Of course, after having thought about a problem using computational thinking skills, the next step should be to use programming skills to implement the solution. This work in progress is exploring ways in which programming can be employed as a tool to teach computational thinking and problem solving. Data is collected from teachers, academics, and professionals from various industries. They are purposively selected because of their knowledge of or interest in the topics of problem solving, computational thinking, and the teaching of programming. This data is analyzed within the paradigm of the grounded theory approach. The results of an initial analysis imply an ordering of complexity associated with computational thinking skills, imply connections between computational thinking skills and programming activities, and imply a relationship between computational thinking skills and other taxonomies of learning.",

In such environments, assessments need to focus on performance in context rather than on tests of abstracted and isolated skills and knowledge. Digital learning environments also provide the potential to assess performance in context, because digital tools make it possible to record rich streams of data about learning in progress. But what assessment methods will use this data to measure mastery of complex problem solving\textemdash the kind of thinking in action that takes place in digital learning environments? Here we argue that one way to address this challenge is through evidence-centered design1\textemdash a framework for developing assessments by systematically linking models of understanding, observable actions, and evaluation rubrics to provide evidence of learning. We examine how evidence-centered design can address the challenge of assessment in new media learning environments by presenting one specific theory-based approach to digital learning, known as epistemic games (http://epistemicgames .org/eg/), and describing a method, epistemic network analysis (ENA), to assess learner performance based on this theory. We use the theory and its related assessment method to illustrate the concept of a digital learning system\textemdash a system composed of a theory of learning and its accompanying method of assessment, linked into an evidence-based, digital intervention. We argue that whatever tools of learning and assessment digital environments use, they need to be integrated into a coherent digital learning system linking learning and assessment through evidence-centered design.",

In this article, we investigate how inequity can become amplified and attenuated within collaborative learning through small interactional moves that accumulate to produce broader patterns of equity or inequity. Our theoretical perspective utilizes Boaler's notion of relational equity and introduces what we term participatory equity. Research was conducted in a computer science course co-taught by the authors and taken by upper-elementary students. Data sources include audio recordings of students' collaborative interactions, ethnographic field notes, student work, and student surveys. This article focuses on a single student, Jason, and his dyadic interactions, and builds upon our previous analyses of his interactions with four higher-performing partners. Findings reveal how the interplay between classroom structures and student enactments shaped two types of inequity during collaborative learning. We conclude by discussing implications for theorizing and analyzing equity and inequity, as well as pedagogical considerations for structuring collaborative learning to attenuate inequity.",

However, the notion of looking at the same object does not necessarily indicate that students are solving the problem together (or learning together). We propose a complementary approach to joint visual attention by augmenting it with joint mental effort (JME). JME is computed as a cross-recurrence of the cognitive load of the peers in a dyad. We use data from 41 dyads to show the synergy between JVA and JME and the insights that they can shed in the collaborative process. The results show that in certain episodes of collaboration (characterized by the dialogue and division of labor strategy of the dyad) combining these two dual-eye tracking measures provide deeper insights about the collaborative processes and performance than JVA alone.",

We use this framework across four international cases: digital media camps, a university-level classroom-based makerspace, a Saturday outdoor makerspace workshop and a classroom-based museum makerspace. Each case study attends to how intra-actions enact agential forces in maker education research\textemdash forces that posthuman and new materialist frameworks help us see.

The configurations of educational institutions, technologies, scientific practices, ethics policies and companies can be usefully framed as the emergence of a new ``knowledge infrastructure'' (Paul Edwards). The idea that we may be transitioning into significantly new ways of knowing \textendash{} about learning and learners \textendash{} is both exciting and daunting, because new knowledge infrastructures redefine roles and redistribute power, raising many important questions. For instance, assuming that we want to shape this infrastructure, how do we engage with the teams designing the platforms our schools and universities may be using next year? Who owns the data and algorithms, and in what senses can an analytics/AI-powered learning system be `accountable'? How do we empower all stakeholders to engage in the design process? Since digital infrastructure fades quickly into the background, how can researchers, educators and learners engage with it mindfully? If we want to work in ``Pasteur's Quadrant'' (Donald Stokes), we must go beyond learning analytics that answer research questions, to deliver valued services to frontline educational users: but how are universities accelerating the analytics innovation to infrastructure transition? Wrestling with these questions, the learning analytics community has evolved since its first international conference in 2011, at the intersection of learning and data science, and an explicit concern with those human factors, at many scales, that make or break the design and adoption of new educational tools. We are forging open source platforms, links with commercial providers, and collaborations with the diverse disciplines that feed into educational data science. In the context of ICLS, our dialogue with the learning sciences must continue to deepen to ensure that together we influence this knowledge infrastructure to advance the interests of all stakeholders, including learners, educators, researchers and leaders. Speaking from the perspective of leading an institutional analytics innovation centre, I hope that our experiences designing code, competencies and culture for learning analytics sheds helpful light on these questions."

Indexical order is central to analyzing how semiotic agents access macro-sociological plane categories and concepts as values in the indexable realm of the micro-contextual. Through such access their relational identities are presupposed and creatively (trans)formed in interaction. We work through several classic examples of indexicality well-known in the literature of sociolinguistics, the clarification of which can be enhanced by using the concept of indexical order, viz., `T/V' deference-indexicality, speech levels, indexically significant variation in phonetics informed by a standard phonological register. We conclude with an analysis of identity-commoditizing indexical overlays such as the American English register here dubbed ``oinoglossia,'' `wine talk'.",

    abstract = "The inclusion of programming topics in the initial grades of school gives rise to debates about the best ways to teach these contents. Programmable toys, activities with physical materials and various games are some of the resources available. Amongst those, digital games possess important elements for learning programming, such as incremental challenges, personalised immediate feedback, and visualisation of the consequences of errors. In this work, we explore the results of an experience based on digital games for teaching programming concepts to young children. Our aim was to investigate how such concepts are presented in the games' interface and what is the impact of the interaction elements on children's comprehension. This work took place in Informatics classes of a Brazilian school, with 42 students aged 5 to 7 years. Data were collected through participant observation, and semi-structured and unstructured interviews, focusing on the main difficulties faced by the children when interacting with the games. Topics, skills and competences were considered according to the syllabus proposed by Computing at School, and encompassed sequences of instructions, repetition loops and conditionals. Results indicate a satisfactory understanding of sequences of instructions and conditionals, but also show challenges with respect to graphical symbols, text and interaction elements identified as hard to understand for the children, making the support of an adult fundamental. Another critical point was the comprehension of the concept of repetition, which made the use of complementary approaches necessary, in particular unplugged playful activities. This shows that despite the increasing number of available digital games that involve programming basics, good solutions for conveying the main concepts to young children have not yet been found, demanding further investigation, possibly towards structured hybrid approaches combining digital games and unplugged activities.",

Additional goals were to identify how researchers defined and measured comprehension, and the various trends that have emerged over the past 25 years, since Dillon's review. Analysis showed that relatively few researchers defined either reading or digital reading, and that the majority of studies relied on researcher-developed measures. Three types of trends were identified in this body of work: incremental (significant increase; e.g., number of studies conducted, variety of digital devices used), stationary (relative stability; e.g., research setting, chose of participants), and iterative (wide fluctuation; e.g., text length, text manipulations). The review concludes by considering the significance of these findings for future empirical research on reading in print or digital mediums.",

(BBN). Logo's design drew upon two theoretical frameworks: Jean Piaget's constructivism and Marvin Minsky's artificial intelligence research at MIT. One of Logo's foundational ideas was that children should have a powerful programming environment. Early Lisp served as a model with its symbolic computation, recursive functions, operations on linked lists, and dynamic scoping of variables. Logo became a symbol for change in elementary mathematics education and in the nature of school itself. The search for harnessing the computer's potential to provide new ways of teaching and learning became a central focus and guiding principle in the Logo language development as it encompassed a widening scope that included natural language, music, graphics, animation, story telling, turtle geometry, robots, and other physical devices.",

The students are reflecting on their analysis of mathematical patterns in a synchronous online environment with text chat and a shared whiteboard. Several interaction methods and group cognitive processes are identified. The analysis suggests a number of conditions and preconditions of such interaction. These are necessary for achieving the potential of CSCL as the accomplishment of high-order cognitive tasks by small groups of learners.

Taking the paradox of mobility\textemdash the simultaneous restricting or regulation of movement that accompanies mobility\textemdash as its central dialectic, a transliteracies framework functions as a flexible heuristic for attending to how meaning making and power are intertwined in and distributed across social and material relationships. We argue that a transliteracies framework encompasses two primary dimensions of mobile literacy practices: (a) the everyday activity of creating, maintaining, and disassembling associations across movements of people and things (indicated by the prefix trans-) and (b) the dynamic and material nature of meaning making in activity (indicated by the plural root word literacies). To trace the emergent and consequential ways mobilities are managed within and across systems, we introduce four analytical tools for inquiry: emergence, uptake, resonance, and scale. These inquiry tools address the paradox of mobility by highlighting the systemic dimensions of practice that create and perpetuate inequities. We argue that these transliteracies tools facilitate an inquiry stance that positions researchers to attend to people's emic meaning-making processes, work to balance multiple perspectives, account for privilege and position, question normative assumptions and beliefs, and engage in and value multiple ways of knowing.",

Thirty-five Kindergarten students participated in a 9-week robotics curriculum using the LEGO WeDo robotics construction kit and the Creative Hybrid Environment for Robotic Programming (CHERP) programming language. A mixed methods data collection approach was employed, including qualitative observational data from the classrooms, as well as quantitative midand post-test assessments of students' programming knowledge using CHERP.

Children used the ScratchJr programming tool to create animated stories, collages, and games. At the end of the learning intervention, children were assessed on their knowledge of the ScratchJr language and underlying reasoning. Specifically, we explored children's errors on the assessment to determine evidence of domain-specific reasoning (e.g. mathematic, verbal, causal). Results show that while all students mastered foundational coding concepts, there were marked differences in performance and comprehension across the three grade levels.

This study looks at the TangibleK Robotics Program in order to determine whether kindergarten boys and girls were equally successful in a series of building and programming tasks. The TangibleK Program consisted of a six lesson robotics and programming curriculum that was implemented in three different kindergarten classrooms (N = 53 students). Although previous research has found that males outperform females in robotics and programming related fields, it was hypothesized that the young age of participants and their limited cultural indoctrination regarding gender stereotypes would allow boys and girls to have equal success in this program. Although boys had a higher mean score than girls on more than half of the tasks, very few of these differences were statistically significant. Boys scored significantly higher than girls only in two areas: properly attaching robotic materials, and programming using Ifs. Overall, both boys and girls were able to successfully complete the program.",

There is limited research on interventions that take place during the formative early childhood years. This study addresses this gap by working with young children (ages 5\textendash 7) and exploring their newly forming attitudes and interest in technology and engineering. The study asked the following research questions: (1) What are children's initial attitudes and ideas about technology and engineering? (2) Do boys and girls differ in their initial attitudes about technology and engineering? (3) Does participation in a 7-week KIBO robotics curriculum have an impact on children's attitudes and ideas about technology and engineering? (4) Do boys and girls perform differently on robotics and programming tasks in early childhood? To answer these questions, public school children in Kindergarten through second grade (N\,=\,105) participated in an introductory KIBO robotics curriculum. Data was collected on their attitudes toward technology and engineering before and after participation in the curriculum as well as their mastery of programming concepts taught. Results provide preliminary evidence that a developmentally appropriate robotics curriculum can increase girls' interest in engineering.",

Children at the school spent one week participating in computer programming activities using a developmentally appropriate tangible programming language called CHERP, which is specifically designed to program a robot's behaviors. The children used CHERP to program ``Robot Recyclers'' that they constructed using parts from LEGO\textregistered{} Education WeDo\texttrademark{} Robotics Construction Sets. The Robot Recyclers were designed to help carry, push, and/or sort recyclable materials found in the classroom. Researchers were participant-observers in the robotics lessons over the course of curriculum implementation. Each lesson was taught by the researchers, with classroom teachers present in order to facilitate classroom management and assist with small group work. A combination of interviews, video, photographs, and classroom observations were used to document the students' experiences. Classroom teachers were also interviewed and asked to complete anonymous pre and post surveys. Results from this study provide preliminary evidence that PreKindergarten children can design, build, and program a robot after just one week of concentrated robotics work. Additionally, results indicate that teachers were able to successfully integrate robotics work into their classrooms that included foundational math and literacy concepts while also engaging children in the arts. However, this study also highlights the difficulties and challenges that must be considered before implementing a robotics curriculum into a PreKindergarten classroom, including opportunities for one-to-one adult assistance during building and programming activities.",

However, modern CT initiatives should be well aware of the broad and deep history of computational thinking, or risk repeating already refuted claims, past mistakes, and already solved problems, or losing some of the richest and most ambitious ideas in CT. This paper presents an overview of three important historical currents from which CT has developed: evolution of computing's disciplinary ways of thinking and practicing, educational research and efforts in computing, and emergence of computational science and digitalization of society. The paper examines a number of threats to CT initiatives: lack of ambition, dogmatism, knowing versus doing, exaggerated claims, narrow views of computing, overemphasis on formulation, and lost sight of computational models.",

We could not find research attempting to devise a model that describes the transition process and how students' learning of programming concepts is affected during the shift. In this paper, we propose a model to describe PL transfer for relative novices. In the model, during initial stages of learning a new language, students will engage in learning three categories of concepts, True Carryover Concepts, False Carryover Concepts, or Abstract True Carryover Concepts; during the transition, learners automatically effect a transfer of semantics between languages based on syntax matching. In order to find support for the model, we conducted two empirical studies. Study 1 investigated near-novice undergraduate students transitioning from procedural Python to object-oriented Java while Study 2 investigated near-novice postgraduate students doing a transfer from object-oriented Java to procedural Python. Results for both studies indicate that students had little or no difficulty with transitioning on TCC due to positive semantic transfer based on syntax similarities while they had the most difficulty transitioning on FCC due to negative semantic transfer. Students had little or no semantic transfer on ATCC due to differences in syntax between the languages. We suggest ways in which the model can inform pedagogy on how to ease the transition process.",

Positive semantic orientation indicates praise (e.g., "honest", "intrepid") and negative semantic orientation indicates criticism (e.g., "disturbing", "superfluous"). Semantic orientation varies in both direction (positive or negative) and degree (mild to strong). An automated system for measuring semantic orientation would have application in text classification, text filtering, tracking opinions in online discussions, analysis of survey responses, and automated chat systems (chatbots). This article introduces a method for inferring the semantic orientation of a word from its statistical association with a set of positive and negative paradigm words. Two instances of this approach are evaluated, based on two different statistical measures of word association: pointwise mutual information (PMI) and latent semantic analysis (LSA). The method is experimentally tested with 3,596 words (including adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) that have been manually labeled positive (1,614 words) and negative (1,982 words). The method attains an accuracy of 82.8\\\% on the full test set, but the accuracy rises above 95\\\% when the algorithm is allowed to abstain from classifying mild words.},

I argue that programming and writing have followed similar historical trajectories as material technologies and explain how they are intertwined in contemporary composition environments.

In this study, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of seven years of data (2012-2018), curated from over 500 articles across 10 publication venues to identify trends in K-12 computing education research such as geographic location and curriculum and concepts taught. The data shows a decrease in the number of studies covering K-12 students receiving computing education even while there is an increase in the number of states adopting and implementing standards. The number of different concepts being researched is increasing, potentially reflecting the growth in what is being taught in the classroom. Demographic data is underreported (e.g., socio-economic status (SES) and disabilities of participants) which could directly limit generalizability of the studies to different learners as well as the ability to replicate and compare studies. We conclude with recommendations for how to better position this work for others trying to use the results to guide their efforts in creating standards or adopting techniques into their classrooms.",

With CS rapidly emerging as a distinct feature of K\textendash 12 public education in the United States, calls to expand CS education are often linked to equity and diversity concerns around expanding access to girls and historically underrepresented students of color. Yet, unlike other critical traditions in education research, equity-oriented CS research has largely failed to interrogate the sociopolitical context of CS education. To move toward a justice-centered approach to equity, Vakil argues, we must simultaneously attend to at least three features of CS education: the content of curriculum, the design of learning environments, and the politics and purposes of CS education reform. While there are many avenues of critical inquiry within and across each of these topics, the focus in this essay is on the role of ethics in the curriculum, the role of identity in CS learning environments, and the significance of a clear political vision for CS education.",

Research on political identities in education tends to be limited to critical pedagogy or civic education contexts, leaving unexamined the role of political identity in supposedly neutral settings, like a computer science (CS) classroom. In this study I offer a conceptual framework that draws on theories of political identity and sociocultural theories of learning to illuminate a process I call disciplinary values interpretation\textemdash a process by which students reflect on the values of a disciplinary domain, as well as who they are and might become in relation to the domain. I then operationalize the framework by analyzing the ways in which students' political identities interacted with their learning processes in a social design experiment conducted in collaboration with a high school teacher in a Computer Science and Technology academy of a large urban high school. Through case studies of two 10th grade students, Stacey and Lupe, I argue that the opportunity to design socially relevant technology provided new resources for disciplinary values interpretation, and had significant implications for how students came to view their own political identities and futures within the discipline of CS. This research has implications for ethical/political theories of learning and also contributes to enduring questions about identification and inequality in education.",

We explore the prevalence of different articulations in the literature and how this has shifted over time. We show that although empowerment has been part of the CCI discourse since the early days, a shift can be noticed in terms of how empowerment is articulated from an emphasis on empowerment in its functional meaning towards a more even distribution and the advent of critical articulations of empowerment. We conclude the paper by looking ahead into a new decade of CCI research and posing three questions to assist CCI researchers in more clearly articulating the nature and understanding of empowerment.",

Whilst numerous studies suggest approaches that provide effective means of teaching programming, to date, no study has attempted to quantitatively compare the impact that different approaches have had on the pass rates of programming courses. In this article, we report the results of a systematic review on articles describing introductory programming teaching approaches, and provide an analysis of the effect that various interventions can have on the pass rates of introductory programming courses. A total of 60 pre-intervention and post-intervention pass rates, describing thirteen different teaching approaches were extracted from relevant articles and analyzed. The results showed that on average, teaching interventions can improve programming pass rates by nearly one third when compared to a traditional lecture and lab based approach.",

Here we use information theory to measure cultural holes and demonstrate our formalism in the context of scientific communication using papers from JSTOR. We extract scientific fields from the structure of citation flows and infer field-specific cultures by cataloging phrase frequencies in full text and measuring the relative efficiency of between-field communication. We then combine citation and cultural information in a novel topographic map of science, mapping citations to geographic distance and cultural holes to topography. By analyzing the full citation network, we find that communicative efficiency decays with citation distance in a field-specific way. These decay rates reveal hidden patterns of cohesion and fragmentation. For example, the ecological sciences are balkanized by jargon, whereas the social sciences are relatively integrated. Our results highlight the importance of enriching structural analyses with cultural data.",

This study presents a framework examining the range of arguments for and projected impacts of CS education programs. Based on data drawn from a researcherfacilitated participatory knowledge building process involving 26 CS education stakeholders who articulated 161 arguments, we identify seven areas of impact present in arguments for universal CS education: (1) economic and workforce development, (2) equity and social justice, (3) competencies and literacies, (4) citizenship and civic life, (5) scientific, technological and social innovation, (6) school improvement and reform and (7) fun, fulfillment and personal agency. Findings show that individual arguments and visions for CS education often reference multiple impact areas. We intend for this framework to support reflection by CS education stakeholders to consider how their current initiatives index different ideologies about what CS4All projects are meant to achieve.",

This descriptive study analyzed student demographic and course-taking data for N=1,537,073 high school students in Texas. Results showed the disparity index can be a useful tool for quantifying and assessing equity in CS education. Disparities in terms of access to and participation in CS education were compounded for students who were members of multiple underrepresented subpopulations (e.g., rural Black females). Disparities differed between measures of access and participation. Implications of this study are that accounting for the intersectionality of students' multiple social identities and distinguishing between access and participation in quantitative measures are key to understanding (and thus addressing) the complexities of educational equity.",

We extended that database to nearly 14,000 English lemmas, providing researchers with a much richer source of information, including gender, age, and educational differences in emotion norms.

In doing so, we present a single quantitative measurement for GCS. Our model, called GCS 2.0 , has face validity for 39 games, each programmed by a pair of middle school children.

In our study, we examined factors predicting college persistence in computer science- and technology-related majors from data collected from female high school students. We fielded a survey that asked about students' interest and confidence in computing as well as their intentions to learn programming, game design, or invent new technology. The survey also asked about perceived social support from friends and family for pursuing computing as well as experiences with computing, including the CS Advanced Placement (AP) exam, out-of-school time activities such as clubs, and internships. Multinomial regression was used to predict persistence in computing and tech majors in college. Programming during high school, taking the CS Advanced Placement exam, and participation in the Aspirations awards program were the best predictors of persistence three years after the high school survey in both CS and other technology-related majors. Participation in tech-related work, internships, or after-school programs was negatively associated with persistence, and involvement with computing sub-domains of game design and inventing new applications were not associated with persistence. Our results suggest that efforts to broaden participation in computing should emphasize education in computer programming.",

    abstract = "Proponents of computing education have long stressed the value of computing for learning in other disciplines. Much of the research towards this end has focused on supporting learning in science, engineering, and mathematics (or STEM). However, a trend towards computing in non-STEM disciplines is growing, yet the research base is more limited. We add to this emerging area of research by investigating the potential for integrating computing and literacy education. This paper reports the results of a six-week intervention during an after-school program in a British primary school. We describe the development of a curriculum unit and report on the first iterative cycle in a design-based research project. Our analysis shows that integrating programming and literacy activities supported novice learners in areas of computing such as algorithm design and program execution through a combination of short problembased tasks and longer project-based activities. Likewise, programming supported learners in creating digital stories by visualizing narrative structure though some caveats were found. We discuss the results of this study and implications for future work in this area.",

    abstract = "There is considerable debate and ambiguity around what constitutes ``computational thinking'' (CT). In contrast to Computer Science which is generally treated as a distinct field of study, CT as a construct highlights the integral relationship between computing and other fields. Many recent efforts seek to map computational thinking by making high-level connections to other school disciplines. We argue that while these efforts may help identify specific curricular areas in which computing is likely to take place, they do not sufficiently capture the specificity and dynamism that is characteristic of meaningful computational integration. Worse, they exclude generative examples of computing integration that exist outside of the traditional STEM context or researcher-led efforts. In this special issue, we offer a counterproposal to one-size-fits-all frameworks of CT by exploring in detail how local, emergent definitions of CT develop across a diversity of spaces of learning. Reflecting on these examples can help researchers and educators alike cultivate an awareness of the ways in which learners and educators leverage computing to think, create, and participate across a variety of spaces.",

However, educational video games bring together two histori\- cally disparate activities: school mathematics and video games. How these two activities complement, compromise, or contradict each other influences how mathematical activity takes shape during game play. Methods: This paper offers a case analysis of two stu\- dents: one who engages with the mathematics as intended by the game and is easily seen as on task, and a second who seems to reject the mathematics as intended by the game and is easily seen as off task. The analysis focuses on how each student's frame of activity influences their mathematical activity during game play. Findings: Findings suggest that, considered from their own frame of activity instead of the frame of the design, both students appear engaged in mathe\- matical sensemaking, albeit in different ways: one as intended by the designer, the other as emerging from game play.",

I combine methods from text mining, machine learning and econometrics to study the existence and extent of gender stereotyping on Economics Job Market Rumors forum. Through a topic analysis, I find that the discourse tends to become significantly less academic or professional oriented, and more about personal information and physical appearance when women are mentioned. The words with the strongest predictive power on gender, selected by the Lasso-logistic model, provide a direct look into the gender stereotyping language on this forum. Moreover, a panel data analysis reveals the state dependence between the content of posts within a thread. In particular, if women are mentioned previously in a thread, the topic is likely to shift from academic to personal. Finally, I restrict the analysis to discussions on specific economists, and find that high-profile female economists tend to receive more attention on EJMR than their male counterparts.",

After a systematic search in online database via keyword search and snowballing approach, 22 SSCI journal papers are included in this review. Nine major factors are examined for each paper: sample groups, duration, robot types, robotics content knowledge, study type, intervention approaches, measurement instruments, major findings and instructional suggestions. The results indicate that: (1) most empirical studies were endured less than two months with a small sample size, the largest sample group was elementary school students, and most studies used LEGO robots; (2) more than half of the studies conducted a non-experimental research design, and observation, questionnaire, interview and evaluation of artifacts are commonly-used measurement instruments; and (3) instructional suggestions proposed in the 22 papers can be clustered into four themes: open environment, targeted design, appropriate pedagogy and timely support. Overall, the 22 papers suggest that RE shows great educational potential in K-12, however, there are indeed situations in which RE did not bring significant improvement in student learning. In view of this, we prospect the future research directions of RE and propose that more intervention studies with rigorous research design could be conducted in K-12.",

In this study, we unpack what constitutes an ``equal partnership'' in PD between adults and children. On the basis of prior literature, we created a new framework that examines the complementary roles between children and adults. Next, we analyzed a case study of a year-long intergenerational design team of children (ages 7-11) and adults. From this analysis, we determined that design partnerships are composed of four dimensions that span from unbalanced to balanced interactions: facilitation, relationship building, design-by-doing, and elaborating together. Finally, to demonstrate its utility, we analyzed two focal codesign sessions using our framework. Our analysis suggests that an equal partnership in PD is not a single static interaction but a development over time of design interactions influenced by context, experience, and participants.",

Because of this, research on complex systems in K\textendash 12 science education has shown a marked increase over the past two decades. In this systematic review, we analyzed 75 empirical studies to determine whether the research (a) collectively represents the goals of educational policy and realworld science, (b) has considered a variety of settings and populations, and (c) has demonstrated systematic investigation of interventions with a view to scale. Results revealed needs in five areas of research: a need to diversify the knowledge domains within which research is conducted, more research on learning about system states, agreement on the essential features of complex systems content, greater focus on contextual factors that support learning including teacher learning, and a need for more comparative research.",

    abstract = "As computational thinking (CT) is being embraced by educational systems worldwide, researchers and teachers have posed important questions such as ``what to teach'' and ``what can be learned.'' These questions are universally crucial to the learning of all subjects. Nevertheless, there is no up-to-date, systematic overview of CT education for K-9 students that attempt to provide answers to these crucial questions. Thus, this systematic review presents a synthesis of 55 empirical studies, providing evidence of the development of computational thinking through programming in Scratch, one of the most popular visual block programming languages in schools. The purpose of this review is to systematically examine the CT skills that can be obtained through Scratch in K-9 based on empirical evidence. This systematic review has adopted Brennan and Resnick's (2012) framework as the basis for defining and identifying the expected CT skills in K-9. The major findings entail what computational thinking skills students in K-9 can learn through Scratch in relation to the framework mentioned above, taking the progression of learning into account. Additional CT skills that are not captured by the framework were identified including input/output, reading, interpreting and communicating code, using multimodal media, predictive thinking, and human-computer interaction. These additional CT skills are not currently presented in Brennan and Resnick's (2012) framework and can be considered as possible supplements to their framework. Furthermore, the paper discusses the difficulties regarding assessment and the progression of the identified skills, as well as problems with study designs. Finally, the paper sets out suggestions for future studies based on the current research gaps.",

Existing techniques that deal with this problem aim at removing all discrimination and do not take into account that part of the discrimination may be explainable by other attributes, such as, e.g., education level. In this context, we introduce and analyze the issue of conditional non-discrimination in classifier design. We show that some of the differences in decisions across the sensitive groups can be explainable and hence tolerable. We observe that in such cases, the existing discrimination aware techniques will introduce a reverse discrimination, which is undesirable as well. Therefore, we develop local techniques for handling conditional discrimination when one of the attributes is considered to be explanatory. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the new local techniques remove exactly the bad discrimination, allowing differences in decisions as long as they are explainable.",

A key expectation is that advanced digital technologies will reconnect citizens and decision makers and enhance trust in planning. However, empirical evidence suggests participation by itself does not foster trust, and many scholars refer to a general weakness of these initiatives to deliver the expected outcomes. Considering that trust is reciprocal, this article will switch focus and concentrate on planners' attitudes towards citizens. Do urban planners generally think that citizens are trustworthy? Even though studies show that public officials are more trusting than people in general, it is possible that they do not trust citizens when interacting with government. However, empirical evidence is scarce. While there is plenty of research on citizens' trust in government, public officials trust in citizens has received little scholarly attention. To address this gap, we will draw on a survey targeted to a representative sample of public managers in Swedish local government (N = 1430). First, urban planners will be compared with other public officials when it comes to their level of trust toward citizens' ability, integrity and benevolence. In order to understand variations in trust, a set of institutional factors will thereafter be tested, along with more commonly used individual factors. In light of the empirical findings, the final section of the article returns to the idea of e-participation as a trust-building strategy. What would make planners trust the citizens in participatory urban planning?",
